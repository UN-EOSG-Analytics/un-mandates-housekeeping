Africa has made progress in providing legal and policy frameworks, establishing institutional mechanisms and developing regional and national action plans for implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. Nevertheless, financing and implementation of laws, policies, strategies and plans needs to be strengthened. UNOAU and the African Union embarked on the hosting of joint high-level events to promote accountability, and to make an urgent call to action for all stakeholders to enhance partnerships in support of these efforts, and advocate for further commitment to increase women’s participation in mediation, peacebuilding and decision-making. Some of the related activities included: (a) a two-day high level virtual dialogue and media campaign on resolution 1325 (2000); (b) two virtual intergenerational dialogues; (c) the launch of the African Union youth campaign to “Silence the Guns”; (d) participation at the second ECOWAS annual gender policy dialogue on women participation in peace and political processes and publication of knowledge products; (e) participation in the African Young Women Leaders Fellowship programme. UNOAU and the African Union Youth Envoy pioneered the establishment of the “Youth silencing the guns” campaign with a view to building young women’s capacity in accordance with the parameters enshrined in the African Youth Charter and to meaningfully engage them to contribute to the Silencing the Guns agenda and jointly implemented the “Africa Young Women Fellowship on Silencing the Guns” project.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "operative", "paragraph_level": 1, "prefix": "74.", "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": [["1325 (2000)", "https://undocs.org/en/S/RES/1325(2000)"], ["1325 (2000)", "https://undocs.org/en/S/RES/1325(2000)"]]}, {"text": "With support from the Governments of Norway and Sweden, two virtual training courses and two virtual intergenerational dialogues were convened with mentors, experts and women leaders who have played a pioneering role in advocating for women’s rights and implementation of the women and peace and security agenda in Africa.

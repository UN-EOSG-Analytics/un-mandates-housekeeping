Nonetheless, the delegation of Turkey expressed the view that the question of customs or political frontiers should be settled by the customs legislation in force within Customs Unions, and recalling previous discussions on this issue, did not consider such an amendment imminently necessary, but was prepared to accept the proposal if the Committee so decided.

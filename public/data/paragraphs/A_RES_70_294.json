For the least developed countries as a group, ODA remains the largest source of external financing. The decline in ODA going to the least developed countries during the past years was a worrisome trend, and the level of 0.09 per cent of gross national income (GNI) attained in 2014 remained below the relevant \n0.15–0.20 per cent target to which many developed countries have committed. In that context, we note the 4 per cent real-term increase in bilateral ODA to the least developed countries in 2015 and the projection that the proportion of ODA to those countries will continue to rise in 2016–2019, suggesting that developed countries are reversing the decline in ODA to the least developed countries in line with the commitment by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at its high-level meeting in 2014 to reverse the declining trend of ODA to the least developed countries.

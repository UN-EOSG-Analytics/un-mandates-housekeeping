of the financial and economic crisis are complex and multifaceted. We recognize that many of the main causes of the crisis are linked to systemic fragilities and imbalances that contributed to the inadequate functioning of the global economy. Major underlying factors in the current situation included inconsistent and insufficiently coordinated macroeconomic policies and inadequate structural reforms, which led to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes. These factors were made acute by major failures in financial regulation, supervision and monitoring of the financial sector, and inadequate surveillance and early warning. These regulatory failures, compounded by over-reliance on market self-regulation, overall lack of transparency, financial integrity and irresponsible behaviour, have led to excessive risk-taking, unsustainably high asset prices, irresponsible leveraging and high levels of consumption fuelled by easy credit and inflated asset prices. Financial regulators, policymakers and institutions failed to appreciate the full measure of risks in the financial system or address the extent of the growing economic vulnerabilities and their cross-border linkages. Insufficient emphasis on equitable human development has contributed to significant inequalities among countries and peoples. Other weaknesses of a systemic nature also contributed to the unfolding crisis, which has demonstrated the need for more effective government involvement to ensure an appropriate balance between the market and public interest.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "operative", "paragraph_level": 1, "prefix": "9.", "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "Response to the crisis", "type": "heading", "heading_level": 1, "paragraph_type": null, "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "We are all in this crisis together.

An immediate priority has been to stabilize the financial markets and restore confidence in them and counter falling demand and the recession. Major actions have already been taken to maintain macroeconomic stability and strengthen the international financial system.

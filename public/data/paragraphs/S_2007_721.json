In a continuing effort to strengthen the United Nations role in this area, I asked Mr. Deng to devote himself full-time to this position. Meantime, I have decided to change his title to that of Special Representative of the Secretary-General to better reflect the role and scope of his mandate. In 2008, I intend to request an upgrade of Mr. Deng’s position to the Under-Secretary-General level, and will include this proposal in the 2008 budget estimates to be submitted to the General Assembly. By making Mr. Deng full-time and by upgrading the level of the post to that of Under-Secretary-General, I would be implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Genocide Prevention. As you are aware, and in line with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on the Prevention of Genocide, the title of Special Representative has been changed by adding “mass atrocities” to make it broader in scope without the need to determine first whether a specific situation has a “genocidal” character or not.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "preambular", "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "To enable the Special Representative to have greater operational impact and in recognizing the link between large scale atrocities and threats to peace and security, his office needs to be strengthened.

Economic growth has been impressive in some places and disappointing in others. Current patterns of globalization have contributed to a sense of insecurity as some countries, particularly developing countries, have been marginalized from the global economy.

The high debt burden has weakened the capacity of many Governments to service their increasing external debt and eroded resources available for social development.

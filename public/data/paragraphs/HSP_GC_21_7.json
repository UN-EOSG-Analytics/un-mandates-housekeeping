Ms. Molokoane re-emphasized the importance of extending public-private partnership to embrace community representatives and of Governments providing local communities with the resources to construct their own houses. Mr. Perera said that alleviation of local poverty required the mobilization of local resources and the inclusion of the local community in all actions. Continuing the theme, Mr. Fabbri said that, in order to be effective, local action to combat poverty required integration of political, social and economic spheres and their representatives. Mr. Mkhatshwa noted that while forums such as the current dialogue were useful for generating guidelines and principles, there was a need for more effective action on the ground. Mr. Segovia observed that politics was the art of making the desired possible and that strong legislative frameworks were a basis for achieving that result. Mr. Ogunbanke said that the energy of young people, too often wasted by exploitative practices, had great potential as a force for poverty reduction.

He affirmed the desire of the Government of Kenya to maintain the position of Nairobi as the central hub of the United Nations system in the developing world and pledged more resources for the improvement of United Nations facilities there. Since independence, the Government of Kenya had advocated strong multilateralism as the basis for peace and prosperity; the solutions to global challenges would not emerge from only one part of the world and called for coalitions of various countries and organizations.

In line with the UN-Habitat agenda, the new Government of Kenya had pledged in its manifesto to tackle the challenges of sustainable urban development; to generate economic opportunities, especially for young people; to expand entrepreneurship; to promote economic growth; and to devolve power to local governments.

Nairobi, as host city to the global headquarters of UN-Habitat and UNEP and the only United Nations headquarters in a developing country, was well placed as a leading diplomatic hub in the region.

Nevertheless, cities were currently failing to provide economic opportunities for all and systemic barriers impeded progress for certain groups, including young people, women and the disabled. The youth bulge in many countries had produced a severe crisis of unemployment, leading to widespread disillusion among young people. In many cities, the informal economy was growing significantly faster than the formal economy, which had a critical impact on the lives of women in particular. As the deadline for the attainment of the targets of the Millennium Development Goals approached, the time had come to assess achievements, failures and lessons learned. The post-2015 development agenda needed to be ambitious and universal and should aim for three broad achievements: first, it must reduce inequality based on human rights, the rule of law and non-discrimination; second, it must transform economies, providing new job opportunities and sustainable production and consumption patterns, empowering women and leaving nobody behind; and, third, it must ensure that environmental sustainability was an integral part of a holistic development framework.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "preambular", "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "Mr. Steiner said that the partnership between UNEP and UN-Habitat had evolved over decades, and had done so not merely as a coincidence or a result of co-location. UNEP and UN-Habitat were inextricably linked, working together on the nexus between environment and urbanization, tackling the need for sustainability of resources and for cities designed to provide spaces where people could thrive. Cities needed to provide decent jobs and adequate infrastructure and living conditions for their citizens, but also had to address global environmental challenges such as climate change and energy and resource efficiency. It was necessary to find ways for the rising global population to flourish in cities while recognizing the Earth’s limitations and decoupling the provision of services from the degradation of natural resources. The theme of the current session, “Sustainable urban development: the role of cities in creating improved economic opportunities for all, with special reference to youth and gender”, reflected the reality that the majority of the world’s population currently lived in cities. Historically, urbanization had often been chaotic, characterized by a lack of planning and ad hoc development. The challenge was to reveal the opportunities in urbanization, providing jobs and sustainability of resources, and transforming urbanization into a driver of development. Sustainable development and the answer to the development challenges of the twenty-first century were to be found in the simultaneous pursuit of social, economic and environmental progress so that modern-day development allowed the cities of the twenty-second century to continue as places of opportunity for their citizens.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "preambular", "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "Following the Executive Director’s introduction of the 15 members of the Advisory Group on Gender Issues, which had been established pursuant to Governing Council resolution 23/17, Ms. Traore, the Group’s Chair, said that the Group was committed to fulfilling its mandate against the backdrop of a complex and difficult global economic and social situation.

It accordingly stood to reason that urban planning must be integrated into industrial strategies, ensuring access to services and food. In that process, Governments and planners could not afford to think in silos.

That problem was particularly acute in Africa, where 80 per cent of the population still depended on charcoal and firewood for heating and cooking, causing untold premature deaths, especially among woman and children, and leading to the wide-scale destruction of forests. The only response to that problem was properly planned urbanization: urban development strategies must be well structured, and public policy should look beyond the short term. In addition, if migrants to cities lacked skills they would bring further problems with them: to remedy that urbanization must be closely linked to education policies. In that context, he drew attention to the forthcoming third session of the Vienna Energy Forum, to be held in Vienna from 28 to 30 May 2013, which would be addressed by the UN-Habitat Executive Director, and stressed that energy efficiency could not be pursued in isolation from urbanization and that energy must be upheld as a goal for sustainable development.

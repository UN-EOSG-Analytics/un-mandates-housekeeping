"International migration has been widely recognized as a vital element in the development process, both influencing and being influenced by development.  For many countries and regions, international migration can also be an influential component affecting population growth.  Consequently, issues related to international migration have been in the international agenda for many years.  The present report reviews selected aspects of international migration and development.  Section I reviews how international migration issues have been examined in the three major United Nations conferences dealing with population as well as at other related major United Nations conferences.  Section II discusses the relationship between international migration and population dynamics, including issues related to definitions, data sources and measurement, the role of international migration in population growth, and levels, trends and characteristics of foreign stock.  Section III examines Governments' views on international migration and how these views have changed over time, as well as implementation and management of migration policies.  Sections IV, V and VI review specific issues related, respectively, to documented migrants, undocumented migrants and refugees and asylum-seekers.  Section VII considers international labour migration.  International migration and gender issues are discussed in section VIII.

Remittances can be used to import capital goods and the essential inputs required to promote investment and capacity utilization, thereby advancing economic development.  Remittances deposited in local banks can provide capital to local entrepreneurs.  However, remittances have been thought to foster dependency on imports and promote high levels of consumption that can result in inflationary pressures.  The evidence validating these views remains weak and contradictory.  Remittances are also viewed as unpredictable because demands for manpower can presumably have wide swings, although trends in remittances from 1960 to 1985 show no such sudden or rapid changes.  At the microlevel, remittances can augment household income and savings, facilitate purchases of consumer durables and investment in productive assets, and alter the local income distribution.

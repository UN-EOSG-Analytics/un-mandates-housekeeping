Globalization presents new opportunities and challenges.  It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development, especially in developing countries.  The impact of recent trends in globalization on developing countries has been uneven.  A limited number of developing countries have been able to take advantage of those trends, attracting large inflows of external private capital and experiencing significant export-led growth and acceleration of growth in per capita gross domestic product.  Many other countries, however, in particular African countries and the least developed countries, have shown slow or negative growth and continue to be marginalized.  As a result, they generally experienced stagnating or falling per capita gross domestic product through 1995.  In these and in some other developing countries, the problems of poverty, low levels of social development, inadequate infrastructure and lack of capital have prevented them from benefiting from globalization.  While continuing their efforts to achieve sustainable development and to attract new investments, these countries still require international assistance in their efforts directed towards sustainable development.  In particular the least developed countries continue to be heavily dependent on a declining volume of official development assistance for the capacity-building and infrastructure development required to provide for basic needs and more effective participation in the globalizing world economy.  In an increasingly interdependent world economy, the responsible conduct of monetary and other macroeconomic policies requires that their potential impact on other countries be taken into account.  Since the Conference, the countries with economies in transition have achieved significant progress in implementing the principles of sustainable development.  However, the need for full integration of these countries into the world economy remains one of the crucial problems on their way towards sustainable development.

On a more positive note, population growth rates have been declining globally, largely as a result of expanded basic education and health care.  That trend is projected to lead to a stable world population in the middle of the twenty-first century.  There has also been progress in social services, with expanding access to education, declining infant mortality and increasing life expectancy in most countries.

Overall, however, trends are worsening.  Many polluting emissions, notably of toxic substances, greenhouse gases and waste volumes are continuing to increase although in some industrialized countries emissions are decreasing.  Marginal progress has been made in addressing unsustainable production and consumption patterns.  Insufficient progress has also been identified in the field of environmentally sound management and adequate control of transboundary movements of hazardous and radioactive wastes.  Many countries undergoing rapid economic growth and urbanization are also experiencing increasing levels of air and water pollution, with accumulating impacts on human health.  Acid rain and transboundary air pollution, once considered a problem only in the industrialized countries, are increasingly becoming a problem in many developing regions.  In many poorer regions of the world, persistent poverty is contributing to accelerated degradation of natural resources and desertification has spread.  In countries seriously affected by drought and/or desertification, especially those in Africa, their agricultural productivity, among other things, is uncertain and continues to decline, thereby hampering their efforts to achieve sustainable development.

The enormity and complexity of the poverty issue could very well endanger the social fabric, undermine economic development and the environment, and threaten political stability in many countries.

The empowerment of women is a critical factor for the eradication of poverty.  Policies that promote such integration to combat poverty, in particular policies for providing basic social services and broader socio-economic development, are effective as well since enhancing the productive capacity of poor people increases both their well-being and that of their communities and societies, and facilitates their participation in resource conservation and environmental protection.

Protecting children from environmental health threats and infectious disease is particularly urgent since children are more susceptible than adults to those threats.  Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries, particularly developing countries, and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases, especially malaria, which is on the increase, to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services, and to provide safe drinking water.  It is also important to reduce indigenous cases of vaccine-preventable diseases through the promotion of widespread immunization programmes, promote accelerated research and vaccine development and reduce the transmission of other major infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).  Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning, particularly on children, it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead, including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide, in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries, particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building.  Strategies at the regional, national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed, bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health, including strategies to make parents, families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco.  The clear linkage between health and the environment needs to be emphasized and the lack of information on the impact of environmental pollution on health should be addressed.

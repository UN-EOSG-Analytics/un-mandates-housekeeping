At its seventh session, in 1999, the Commission, in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly for the review and appraisal of the implementation of the Programme of Action, further reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action and identified the following areas for priority action, including the means for their implementation: climate change, including climate variability and sea level rise; natural disasters; freshwater resources; coastal and marine resources; energy; and tourism. The Commission recognized that the sectoral focus of its review should not detract from the need for a full and comprehensive implementation of all chapters of the Programme of Action. The Commission emphasized that the Programme of Action remained a valuable and living framework for the sustainable development efforts being undertaken by small island developing States, and noted the actions taken by Governments, regional commissions and organizations, organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in support of activities relating to its implementation.

It also noted that, in accordance with their responsibility, considerable efforts had been made by small island developing States at the national and regional levels to meet the priorities and objectives of the Programme of Action, especially the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies.

Small island developing States share many concerns and constraints with regard to sustainable development and are affected by them in varying degrees. The specificity of the situation and needs of small island developing States in relation to sustainable development were acknowledged in Agenda 21 and further articulated in the Programme of Action. Constraints to the sustainable development of small island developing States include a narrow resource base, which does not allow those States to benefit from economies of scale; small domestic markets and heavy dependence on a few external and remote markets; high costs of energy, infrastructure, transportation, communication and servicing; long distances from export markets and import sources; low and irregular international traffic volumes; little resilience to natural disasters; rising populations; high volatility of economic growth; limited opportunities for the private sector and a disproportionately large reliance of their economies on the public sector; and fragile natural environments.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "operative", "paragraph_level": 1, "prefix": "3.", "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "At its seventh session, the Commission on Sustainable Development also noted that since the holding of the Global Conference in 1994, the pace of globalization and trade liberalization had affected the economies of small island developing States by presenting new problems and opportunities for them and increasing the need for focused implementation of the Programme of Action. As a result of globalization, national policy frameworks and external factors, including trade impacts, have become critical in determining the success or failure of small island developing States in their national efforts. These States are particularly concerned that the specific problems and vulnerabilities confronting them exacerbate the difficulties encountered in their efforts to integrate into the world economy, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, commodities and capital markets. In order to address these challenges, small island developing States are undertaking domestic reforms in the area of macroeconomic policy to facilitate integration into the global economy. At the regional level, they have also begun to put in place appropriate policy frameworks and arrangements to integrate their economic, social and environmental approaches to sustainable development in order to maximize opportunities available to them and minimize the constraints they face.

The Commission assessed the progress made since the Global Conference by the international community in responding to the financial provisions of the Programme of Action, including through mobilization of resources, initiation of discussions on financing for development, work on a vulnerability index, donor coordination, strengthened and expanded partnerships, mainstreaming sustainable development activities and working to ensure a better response from institutions to efforts of small island developing States to achieve sustainable development, especially through capacity-building. The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels, including the international level, to strengthen support, including financial support from all sources, to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity- and institution-building, facilitating the access of those States to, and the transfer and use of, environmentally sound technology, as set forth in the Programme of Action.

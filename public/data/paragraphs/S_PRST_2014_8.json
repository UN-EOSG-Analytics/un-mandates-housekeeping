The Council notes in particular the reported death in late 2013 of the LRA’s second-in-command Okot Odhiambo, who was indicted by the International Criminal Court and the capture of LRA mid-level commander Charles Okello in April 2014. The Council welcomes the AU-RTF’s enhanced operations against the LRA in recent months, which have increased pressure on the LRA command structure and resulted in several significant defections of LRA fighters and the rescue of women and children from the LRA’s ranks. The Council expresses its concern at the creation of potential security vulnerabilities resulting from the increased instability in South Sudan that could be exploited by the LRA. The Council urges all regional governments to fulfil all their commitments under the AU RCI-LRA and to provide the necessary basic provisions for their security forces. In this regard, the Council welcomes the decisions of the recent AU RCI-LRA to hold quarterly meetings as well as a Summit of RCI-LRA Member States. The Council notes the importance of continued international support for the AU-RTF’s operations, logistics, and headquarters. In this regard, the Council welcomes the continued advisory and logistical support provided by the United States as well as funding provided by the European Union. The Council underlines the need for all military action against the LRA to be conducted in compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, as applicable, and to minimise the risk of harm to civilians in all areas of operation and to take into account the association of children with the LRA.

The Security Council expresses its continued concern that the instability and security vacuum in the CAR continue to negatively affect counter-LRA operations. The Council further notes with concern reports of LRA attacks, as well as interactions between the LRA and other armed groups, in areas of the CAR outside of the AU-RTF’s principal area of operations. In this regard, the Council emphasises the need for strong coordination and information-sharing between the AU-RTF and the African-led International Support Mission for the Central African Republic (MISCA), as well as with the United Nations Integrated Stabilisation Mission in CAR (MINUSCA), in the context of their protection of civilians activities, human rights monitoring, and counter-LRA operations, as appropriate.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "preambular", "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": [["S/2014/319", "http://undocs.org/S/2014/319"]]}, {"text": "“The Security Council welcomes the steps taken to deliver an enhanced, comprehensive, and more regional approach to the humanitarian situation, including assistance to victims of sexual violence and other attacks and urges further progress in this regard.", "type": "paragraph", "heading_level": null, "paragraph_type": "preambular", "paragraph_level": null, "prefix": null, "action_verb": null, "action_verb_type": null, "action_verb_normalized": null, "links": []}, {"text": "“The Security Council underlines the primary responsibility of States in the LRA-affected region to protect civilians.

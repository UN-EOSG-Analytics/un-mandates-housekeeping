This is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 11 and other Sustainable Development Goals relevant to urbanization and human settlements. UN-Habitat support to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda will be further complemented by the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning approved by the Governing Council in 2015. In addition, the Guiding Principles for City Climate Action Planning, endorsed by 45 UN-Habitat partners at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris, support these policies. The accreditation of UN-Habitat to the Adaptation Fund as a multilateral implementing entity could enhance its capacity to implement the New Urban Agenda. The strategy of subprogramme 2 will be informed by these global frameworks and focus on supporting their implementation, within the scope of the mandate of UN-Habitat, and build on multi-stakeholder initiatives supporting national, subnational and city authorities in the implementation of the climate actions in support of the Paris Agreement.

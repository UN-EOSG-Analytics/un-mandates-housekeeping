In this context studies of local customs and traditions could be undertaken by national authorities with a view to examining to what extent they might be fostering and encouraging attitudes or values contrary to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and how these customs and traditions can eventually be eliminated. Charitable and philanthropic foundations might be invited to consider making grants for programmes of research and study in this field and to make bursaries and fellowships available for research in human rights. Responsible authorities of colleges, and of elementary and secondary schools, could be invited to review their curricula and textbooks in order to eradicate bias, intentional and unintentional, towards the preservation of ideas and concepts contrary to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to introduce courses of study which positively promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

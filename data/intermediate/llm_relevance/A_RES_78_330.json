DGACM (via the Office of the Under‑Secretary‑General and the Coordinator for Multilingualism hosted in the Department) is the Secretariat entity responsible for Secretariat‑wide multilingualism coordination and for overseeing quality of multilingual services (see PPB paras 2.3, 2.9 and subprogramme descriptions on documentation/technology). This SG request will be implemented operationally by DGACM units responsible for translation tools and multilingual quality control."

DGACM’s Subprogramme 1 provides procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and its committees (PPB paras 2.1(a), 2.20). This operative paragraph therefore imposes an operational obligation that DGACM implements through its procedural support services."

DGACM’s documentation and translation services (Subprogramme 3 and publishing services) are the Secretariat units that produce authoritative multilingual versions of official texts (PPB paras 2.1(c), 2.46–2.47). The SG direction will therefore be carried out in practice by DGACM translation/publishing teams."

Implementation of the Framework will therefore be executed through DGACM functions."

The paragraph directs resource/action on the Office that is located within DGACM (PPB para 2.3 references the Coordinator and Office of the Coordinator for Multilingualism). It therefore relates directly to DGACM’s staffing/capacity to carry out its mandated coordination role."

The paragraph explicitly references conference management services—DGACM’s core programme (PPB paras 2.1(a),(c); subprogrammes 3 and 4)—and thus constitutes a mandate that DGACM is the implementing service for."

Ensuring simultaneous issuance is a central DGACM operational mandate (PPB paras 2.46–2.47, subprogramme 3 deliverables on simultaneous issuance), so this SG instruction will be carried out by DGACM documentation/publishing services."

The SG request therefore relates to activities that DGACM and its language training functions deliver."

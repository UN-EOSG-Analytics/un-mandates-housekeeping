This is a clear Secretariat task; DGACM’s PPB states it provides procedural and technical secretariat support and organizes meeting timetables and services, so DGACM would implement this requirement."

      "relevance_comment": "Para 14 requires the Secretary‑General to assist in preparing the provisional agenda and the first draft of the Conference reports to the General Assembly. DGACM’s subprogramme work includes substantive/procedural secretariat support and preparation/distribution of parliamentary documentation, so it implements this obligation."

      "relevance_comment": "Para 15 instructs the Secretary‑General, at the Conference’s request, to provide professional assistance by preparing background papers, bibliographies and compiling data relevant to negotiations. This maps directly to DGACM’s documentation and substantive secretariat functions (translation/compilation of materials, briefing papers)."

Although broad, this is an explicit delegation to the Secretariat; DGACM, as the Secretariat’s conference management arm, implements many such functions per its PPB (conference servicing, documentation, multilingual support)."

      "relevance_comment": "Para 42 directs that communications from non‑governmental organizations to the Conference, President or Secretariat be retained by the Secretariat, made available to delegations on request and that a list be circulated. This assigns a records‑management and distribution task to the Secretariat that aligns with DGACM’s document handling and publication responsibilities."

This explicitly tasks the Secretariat with assistance in drafting and timely distribution—functions reflected in DGACM’s PPB."

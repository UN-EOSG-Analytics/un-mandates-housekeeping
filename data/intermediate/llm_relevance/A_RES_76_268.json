      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph requests the Secretariat to continue to provide procedural notes, statements and remarks for Presidents and Chairs in the United Nations official language spoken by the presiding officer. DGACM’s PPB (see overall orientation and subprogramme 1: para. 2.1(a), 2.1(d) and subprogramme responsibilities) shows that the Department provides procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly, its committees and subsidiary organs. This paragraph therefore creates an obligation implemented in practice by DGACM through its procedural secretariat services."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph requests the Department of Global Communications, the Office of Information and Communications Technology and the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management to collaborate to explore cost‑efficient technological options to ensure equal availability, searchability, completeness and user‑friendly presentation of webcast archives in all official languages on the United Nations website, and requests the Secretary‑General to report on results. This explicitly directs DGACM to collaborate on a technical/multilingual archival task. It connects to DGACM’s PPB role in Secretariat‑wide coordination of multilingualism (para. 2.3), and to its responsibility for meetings, publishing and digital platforms (subprogramme 4 and programme support, paras. 2.59, 2.67, 2.226–2.229), which is the area in which DGACM would implement the requested collaboration."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph requests the Secretary‑General to continue to ensure, through the provision of documentation services and meetings and publishing services under conference management, including high‑quality translation and interpretation, effective multilingual communication equally in all the official languages among representatives of Member States in intergovernmental organs and United Nations expert bodies. While addressed to the Secretary‑General, this directs action ‘through … conference management’ — the functions that DGACM carries out (documentation services; meetings and publishing; translation and interpretation are core DGACM functions described throughout the PPB, e.g., paras. 2.1(a),(c) and subprogrammes 3 and 4). Thus it imposes an implementable obligation on DGACM’s service delivery."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph encourages the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, upon request, to document policy guidance regarding translation outsourcing and quality standards for use by relevant departments and offices of the Secretariat. This is an explicit request to DGACM. It aligns directly with the Department’s documented remit to provide documentation services, translation quality management and terminology support (see subprogramme 3 strategy and planned results, paras. 2.46, 2.52–2.53), and thus constitutes a mandate‑giving paragraph for DGACM."

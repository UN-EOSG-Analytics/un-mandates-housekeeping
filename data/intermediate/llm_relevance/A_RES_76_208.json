      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph 15 requests the Secretary‑General to support the commemoration of UNEP@50 and invites voluntary contributions for its preparation and participation. Implementation of that request will require Secretariat support for the event (conference planning and management, multilingual meeting and documentation services where applicable, protocol and host‑country liaison, participant registration and facilitation). Those are squarely within DGACM’s remit as set out in its PPB (e.g., PPB paras. 2.1(c) on conference‑servicing support including at Nairobi, 2.1(d) on protocol and host country liaison services, and the Office of the Under‑Secretary‑General responsibilities in 2.201–2.202). Thus the paragraph creates a task for the Secretary‑General that DGACM is the entity within the Secretariat normally responsible for implementing."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative paragraph 18 decides to include, in the provisional agenda of the General Assembly’s seventy‑seventh session, the sub‑item 'Report of the United Nations Environment Assembly'. By placing the item on the Assembly agenda the General Assembly effectively requires Secretariat servicing of that agenda item (preparation and issuance of documentation, agenda management, meeting servicing and other secretariat functions). DGACM’s PPB explicitly assigns it responsibility for facilitation and substantive/technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and its agenda items (see PPB para. 2.1(a) and the subprogramme 1 description of providing technical secretariat services), so this decision entails implementation tasks for DGACM."

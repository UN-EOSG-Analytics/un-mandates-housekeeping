DGACM’s PPB explicitly describes its role in publishing, distribution and multilingual documentation services (subprogrammes 3 and 4) and in making documents available to Member States and the public, so it would be the implementing service for the publication/dissemination called for here."

      "relevance_comment": "Requests the Secretary‑General to invite the Government of Japan to nominate a scientist to the Committee. This is an instruction to the Secretary‑General to undertake outreach/communications and nomination follow‑up; DGACM’s PPB identifies the Protocol and Liaison Service and executive/administrative components (executive direction and management, Protocol and Liaison Service) as providing protocol and liaison support to the Secretary‑General and servicing administrative matters, so DGACM would be involved in implementing such an invitation."

The Secretariat is responsible for preparing and transmitting Assembly records and parliamentary documentation; DGACM’s PPB describes responsibility for parliamentary documentation and servicing of the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies, so DGACM would implement the transmission and provision of those records."

      "relevance_comment": "Paragraph 9 adopts the Protocol and opens it for signature at United Nations Headquarters in New York. While it does not name a Department, this creates an organizational obligation to host and service signature arrangements at UN Headquarters (signature ceremonies, meeting rooms, participant registration, distribution of documents and related protocol support). The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management’s PPB (see paras. 2.1 (a), 2.1 (c) and 2.202) shows it is responsible for conference-servicing, meeting and documentation support and protocol services at Headquarters, so DGACM would be the implementing service for those tasks."

      "relevance_comment": "Paragraph 133 provides the specific instruction that the Protocol \"shall be open to all States for signature at United Nations Headquarters in New York…\". That operational requirement obliges the Organization to receive signatures at Headquarters and to provide the logistical, conference‑servicing and protocol arrangements to enable signature and access by delegations. Those operational duties fall squarely within DGACM’s remit per its PPB (conference‑servicing and protocol functions at Headquarters as described in paras. 2.1 (a), 2.1 (c) and 2.202), so DGACM would be the primary implementing entity."

      "relevance_comment": "Text: “The Secretary-General shall make available to the Commission the appropriate staff and facilities required by the Commission to fulfil its task.” This directs the Secretary‑General to provide staff and facilities to support the Commission. DGACM (per its PPB) is the UN entity responsible for providing procedural and technical secretariat support, conference services and the staffing/facilities necessary for intergovernmental bodies (see PPB: responsibility for procedural and technical secretariat support and conference‑servicing across duty stations, e.g. 2.1(a),(c); programme support description). Thus paragraph 36 creates an obligation that the Secretariat implement — operationally delivered by DGACM — by supplying staff, facilities and conference‑servicing."

Those Secretariat preparatory and organizational tasks are precisely the kinds of procedural/secretariat functions DGACM performs (PPB: DGACM provides substantive and technical secretariat support, planning and coordination of conference services, and document/service management for intergovernmental bodies — see PPB summary and subprogramme strategies such as 2.1(a),(c), 2.33(d))."

DGACM’s PPB shows it implements such tasks (member‑state communications, circulation and management of submissions and agenda items, see PPB: provision of procedural secretariat support and management of documentation and meeting requests — e.g. 2.1(a); 2.33(d))."

DGACM routinely carries out inter‑org coordination and solicitation/management of submissions as part of its secretariat and documentation services (see PPB: coordination with other organs and providing substantive and technical secretariat support, e.g. 2.1(c),(f) and 2.33(d)), so this paragraph imposes actionable tasks implemented by DGACM."

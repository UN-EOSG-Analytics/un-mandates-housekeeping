DGACM’s PPB shows it is responsible for parliamentary/documentation services (subprogramme 3; see 2.45–2.53, 2.46 strategy and 2.57 deliverables) and would be expected to implement changes to documentation production and publication formats arising from this decision."

This creates a requirement that affects document processing and editorial control. DGACM’s documentation service (subprogramme 3: translation/editing/desktop publishing; see 2.46(a),(d), 2.50–2.56) implements and enforces such limits in the production workflow."

DGACM’s documentation and publishing subprogrammes (subprogramme 3 and subprogramme 4; see 2.46, 2.59 and the discussion of timeliness/simultaneous issuance 2.48–2.56, 2.61–2.69) are the Secretariat units that would operationalize these limits in document intake, editing and issuance."

This is a decision on the form and language of records and on issuance priorities. DGACM directly provides verbatim reporting, summary records, and publishing services (subprogramme 4 meetings and publishing services and subprogramme 3 documentation; see 2.59(a), 2.48–2.56, 2.61–2.69) and would be responsible for implementing these changes to record production and dissemination."

DGACM’s documentation services (subprogramme 3: translation/editing/précis-writing; see 2.46(a),(d) and 2.48–2.56) are the Secretariat function that would perform those translations and manage fulfilment of such requests."

DGACM’s work on planning of intergovernmental meetings and tools (subprogramme 2: planning and coordination; see 2.33(a),(e), and references to e-deleGATE and scheduling in 2.20–2.30) is directly implicated in implementing this allocation."

DGACM is responsible for surge planning, workforce/capacity management and temporary assistance to handle demand (see 2.7, 2.59(b), and programme support on capacity/planning 2.226–2.229), so it would implement measures to meet this target."

DGACM’s mandate covers conference services, planning and coordination (including servicing of meetings and related logistics) across duty stations (see 2.1(a),(c), subprogramme 2 and programme support sections), and DGACM would be the implementing service for the Secretariat’s provision of meeting and documentation support related to such field activities, as applicable."

This establishes a process/timetable that the Secretariat must follow in scheduling and budgeting. DGACM is the Secretariat conference-management programme that prepares schedules, harmonized indicators and inputs for budget/resource allocation (see 2.33, 2.37–2.38 on reporting of KPIs and global harmonization, and programme support responsibilities 2.226–2.231) and would implement the review and any resulting scheduling/budget changes."

DGACM is the programme that is budgeted for and that provides the conference services and staffing that correspond to those budget lines (see resource and programme sections 2.190–2.197, and subprogramme resource explanations for meeting and documentation services 2.206–2.216), so DGACM would be responsible for delivering services funded under that budget."

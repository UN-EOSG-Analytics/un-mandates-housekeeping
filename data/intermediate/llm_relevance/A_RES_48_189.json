      "relevance_comment": "Creates a clear obligation that the first session of the Conference of the Parties be held on specific dates. DGACM’s PPB (mandates at paras. 2.1(a) and 2.1(c) and the subprogramme descriptions) shows the Department is responsible for facilitation and provision of procedural and technical secretariat and conference‑servicing support for United Nations conferences and special meetings. Thus paragraph 22 translates into tasks for DGACM to plan, schedule and provide the secretariat, meeting‑servicing, documentation, interpretation and related logistical support required to convene that session."

      "relevance_comment": "Expresses the Assembly’s acceptance of the Government of Germany’s offer to host the first session in Berlin. While not naming the Department, this decision entails practical arrangements (host‑country liaison, protocol, onsite conference services) that DGACM’s PPB shows it implements (see para. 2.1(c) on conference‑servicing at locations outside Headquarters and para. 2.1(d) on protocol and host‑country liaison). Accordingly, this paragraph gives rise to implementation tasks for DGACM to coordinate logistics and protocol with the host."

      "relevance_comment": "Decides to include the session in the calendar of conferences and meetings for 1994–1995. DGACM’s mandate (e.g., para. 2.1 and the planning/coordination subprogramme descriptions) includes management of the calendar of conferences/meetings and related scheduling functions. This paragraph therefore directs an administrative action (calendar inclusion and associated scheduling coordination) that DGACM is responsible for implementing."

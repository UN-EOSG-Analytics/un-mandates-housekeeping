DGACM’s mandate to provide substantive/technical secretariat support and to prepare and issue parliamentary documentation (PPB paras. 2.1(a),(c); subprogramme 3 documentation services, para. 2.46) means it would play a central role in producing, translating, issuing and distributing the Secretary‑General’s report to the Assembly."

      "relevance_comment": "Directs the Secretariat to continue updating regularly and equally the multilingual web page devoted to the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly in all six official languages. This is a clear instruction to the Secretariat to provide and maintain multilingual web content. DGACM’s programme budget (see Mandates and background and sections on multilingualism, coordination and digital platforms) identifies the Department as the Secretariat service responsible for multilingualism coordination and for conference- and Assembly-related web/e‑services (e.g., e‑deleGATE, iGov and related multilingual portals). Therefore paragraph 2 creates a Secretariat-level task that DGACM is expected to implement (maintain and update the multilingual web page)."

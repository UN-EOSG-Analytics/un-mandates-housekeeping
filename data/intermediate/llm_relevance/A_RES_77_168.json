      "relevance_comment": "This operative paragraph (“Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy‑ninth session … the sub‑item ‘Report of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme’”) is a General Assembly decision to place an item on the Assembly’s provisional agenda. DGACM’s programme (subprogramme 1) is responsible for facilitation and substantive/technical secretariat support to the General Assembly, including agenda management, preparation and issuance of related documentation and meeting servicing. Thus this paragraph creates an actionable obligation that DGACM will implement (adding the item to the provisional agenda, servicing the item during the session, preparing and issuing the associated documentation and providing requisite meeting and protocol support)."

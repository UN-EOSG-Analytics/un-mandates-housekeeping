      "relevance_comment": "Text: “The Secretary‑General of the United Nations shall appoint the staff of the Commission, which shall form part of the Secretariat of the United Nations.” Task created: directs the Secretary‑General to appoint and establish the Commission’s secretariat staff. Connection to DGACM PPB: DGACM provides substantive and technical secretariat support to intergovernmental and expert bodies and manages conference‑servicing and secretariat functions (see programme description and Executive Office / programme support sections). While the paragraph instructs the Secretary‑General, the operational implementation (staffing the Commission’s secretariat, onboarding, and providing day‑to‑day secretariat support and conference services) is carried out within the Secretariat by Departments such as DGACM (Executive Office and conference‑servicing units), so this paragraph creates an action the Department is expected to operationally support."

      "relevance_comment": "Text: “The first session of the Commission shall be called by the Secretary‑General of the United Nations as soon as practicable after the Commission has been created by the Economic and Social Council.” Task created: directs the Secretary‑General to convene the Commission’s first session. Connection to DGACM PPB: DGACM is responsible for planning, coordinating and providing substantive and technical secretariat and conference services for intergovernmental bodies and conferences (including calling/organizing sessions, meeting planning, documentation and conference logistics). Thus, although the paragraph addresses the Secretary‑General, DGACM would be the Secretariat entity implementing the practical arrangements (meeting convening, logistics, documentation and related conference services) required by this instruction."

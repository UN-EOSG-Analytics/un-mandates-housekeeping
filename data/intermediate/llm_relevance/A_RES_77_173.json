While addressed to the Secretary‑General, DGACM’s PPB shows the Department is responsible for preparing, processing, editing, simultaneous issuance and publishing of Secretariat reports and other parliamentary documentation for the Assembly (subprogrammes 1, 3 and 4). Thus DGACM would be engaged in implementing the request by supporting production, formatting, issuance and publication of the Secretary‑General’s progress report and managing its placement on the Assembly’s documentation and agenda systems."

      "relevance_comment": "This operative paragraph decides to include the item “Follow‑up to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and strengthening of UN‑Habitat” in the provisional agenda of the seventy‑ninth session of the General Assembly. That decision requires Secretariat action to place the item on the Assembly’s provisional agenda and to service it. DGACM’s PPB shows the Department provides procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and manages agenda, documentation and related conference services (subprogramme 1 and programme support), so DGACM would implement the Assembly’s decision by adding the item to the agenda and preparing/processing the associated documentation and meeting services."

This creates a clear obligation on heads of entity (including the Under‑Secretary‑General for General Assembly and Conference Management/DGACM) to accept, review and manage delegations via the portal — an administrative requirement directly linked to DGACM’s programme support and executive direction responsibilities for resource and authority management described in the PPB."

      "relevance_comment": "2.6 provides that when an officer‑in‑charge or officer ad interim is assigned, authorities are automatically delegated to that person unless formally specified otherwise. This imposes an internal operational duty on DGACM to ensure continuity of delegated authorities during temporary appointments, which connects to the PPB’s emphasis on integrated global management, succession planning and continuity of operations."

      "paragraph_index": 16,
      "relevance_comment": "2.7 states that a delegation to a head of entity carries personal responsibility and that the Secretary‑General may enquire into or suspend delegated authorities. This places accountability obligations on the DGACM head and senior management (reflected in the PPB’s executive direction and management section) to exercise delegated authorities properly and maintain compliance."

      "relevance_comment": "2.9 requires delegatees to promptly and fully comply with all reporting requirements set by the delegator and the Under‑Secretaries‑General. This obliges DGACM to meet reporting and oversight duties associated with any delegated financial or HR authorities, tying to the PPB’s descriptions of the Executive Office’s role in reporting, resource planning and implementation of accountability controls."

      "relevance_comment": "2.10 obliges any staff member receiving delegated authority to exercise high standards of professionalism and to discharge accountability for implementing mandates. This imposes behavioural and procedural obligations on DGACM staff (interpreters, editors, managers) consistent with the PPB’s emphasis on quality, performance management and stewardship of resources."

      "relevance_comment": "4.1 directs that heads of entity will receive notifications of delegations via the online portal and must acknowledge receipt. This imposes an action requirement on the DGACM head to use the portal to accept and record authorities, aligning with the PPB’s responsibilities for managing departmental authorities and administration."

      "paragraph_index": 28,
      "relevance_comment": "4.2 requires heads of entity to use the online portal to view delegation descriptions and to subdelegate authority (and to view subdelegations). This creates a procedural obligation for DGACM management to manage internal subdelegations through the portal — directly relevant to the PPB’s descriptions of the Department’s internal management, delegation of responsibilities and harmonization of operations across duty stations."

      "relevance_comment": "5.1 obliges heads of entity to subdelegate selected authorities to staff, aligning authorities with responsibilities and ensuring segregation of duties, with subdelegations made through the portal. This mandates DGACM to formalize internal delegations (e.g., to programme support, duty station directors) in support of delivering the conference management and documentation services set out in the PPB."

      "relevance_comment": "5.2 provides that, where the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance determines an entity’s mandate requires subdelegation of specific authorities to another head of entity, such subdelegation shall be made through the portal. This creates an obligation on DGACM to accept and implement inter-entity subdelegations (or request them) where mandates require shared execution, which connects to the PPB’s references to shared responsibilities among Headquarters and the Geneva/Vienna/Nairobi duty stations."

      "paragraph_index": 37,
      "relevance_comment": "5.3 requires that heads may suspend/amend/revoke subdelegated authorities through the portal, communicate reasons in writing to the delegatee, and maintain a record. This mandates DGACM management to maintain records of internal authority changes and communicate them formally — an administrative control tied to the PPB’s emphasis on governance, oversight and implementation of the delegation of authority framework."

      "paragraph_index": 38,

This imposes a duty on DGACM to keep its internal subdelegation structure aligned with any revisions to its delegated authorities, supporting the PPB’s functions around workforce planning, role alignment and standardized administrative processes."

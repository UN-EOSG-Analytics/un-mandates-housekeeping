      "relevance_comment": "Requests the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme network, to prepare a discussion guide for the regional preparatory meetings for the Fifteenth Congress and for the Congress itself. This is an instruction to the Secretariat to produce conference documentation. The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) explicitly lists documentation, publishing and conference-servicing responsibilities in its PPB (see subprogramme 3: documentation services — e.g., para. 2.46 on delivering multilingual documentation, and subprogramme 4 on publishing services, para. 2.59). DGACM would therefore be expected to implement the preparation, publication and distribution aspects of the requested discussion guide (production, translation, simultaneous issuance and dissemination platforms)."

      "relevance_comment": "Also requests the Secretary-General to facilitate the organization of the regional preparatory meetings and to make available the necessary resources for the participation of the least developed countries in those meetings and in the Fifteenth Congress. This is a Secretariat-level mandate to organize meetings and provide participant support. DGACM’s PPB explicitly assigns it the planning and management of meetings and provision of conference services, including liaison, registration and support for delegates (see paras. 2.1(a),(c),(d); subprogramme 2 on planning and coordination of conference services, para. 2.33). Thus DGACM would be expected to implement the operational/ logistical and conference-servicing elements of this request (meeting planning, registration/participant facilitation, publishing and distribution of documents, and host/participant liaison)."

      "relevance_comment": "Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate the organization of ancillary meetings of non-governmental and professional organizations participating in the Fifteenth Congress, as well as meetings of professional and geographical interest groups, and to take appropriate measures to encourage participation of the academic and research community. The facilitation and organization of ancillary/side events and related registration/rooming/logistics are core conference-management functions. DGACM’s mandate and programme plan cover provision of conference-servicing and meeting support (see para. 2.1(c) and subprogramme 2 on planning and coordination of conference services, para. 2.33, and para. 2.202 on the Protocol and Liaison Service). DGACM would therefore be expected to implement the Secretariat’s facilitation of ancillary meetings and related participant engagement measures."

      "relevance_comment": "Requests the Secretary-General to ensure proper follow-up to the present resolution and to report thereon to the General Assembly through the Commission at its thirty-third session. This places an obligation on the Secretariat to coordinate follow-up and reporting. DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department’s role in facilitating orderly conduct of intergovernmental bodies and follow-up actions and providing substantive and technical secretariat support to commissions and committees (see para. 2.1(a) and subprogramme 1 on General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs, paras. 2.19–2.20). DGACM would be expected to support or implement the secretariat, documentation and reporting functions needed to satisfy this follow-up request (e.g., preparing and issuing the relevant documentation, servicing the Commission session where the report is considered)."

This is an instruction to the Secretariat to prepare and submit an implementation report. DGACM’s programme includes the preparation, publication and issuance of parliamentary documentation and reports (subprogramme 3 on documentation services and subprogramme 4 on meetings and publishing services, paras. 2.46 and 2.59). DGACM would therefore be expected to carry out the operational work of producing, translating, publishing and issuing the Secretary-General’s report as part of the Secretariat’s implementation of this paragraph."

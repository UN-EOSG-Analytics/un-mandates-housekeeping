DGACM’s PPB shows the Department is responsible for conference management, protocol, host‑country liaison and provision of Secretariat support for meetings and special events (see para. 2.1(a),(c),(d); executive direction and management paras. 2.201–2.203; and the various subprogrammes on planning and meetings). Operationally, DGACM would implement the Secretary‑General’s \"support\" by providing conference‑servicing, logistical and protocol arrangements and processing related documentation for the event."

DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department as the Secretariat unit that facilitates and provides the procedural, conference‑servicing and organizational arrangements for General Assembly meetings and high‑level events (see para. 2.1(a),(c); subprogramme 2 planning and coordination paras. 2.33, 2.207; and executive direction paras. 2.201–2.203). Thus this paragraph creates Secretariat/organizational tasks that DGACM implements (meeting planning, rooming, interpretation/translation/publishing and protocol support)."

DGACM would therefore implement parts of the Secretary‑General’s submission by processing, preparing multilingual versions, publishing and issuing the requested report and related documentation for the Assembly."

DGACM’s mandate covers facilitation and substantive/technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and its agenda items (see para. 2.1(a) and subprogramme 1 paras. 2.19–2.21), so DGACM would carry out the practical Secretariat work required to place the item on the provisional agenda and service the subsequent meetings."

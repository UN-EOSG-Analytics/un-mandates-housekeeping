The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) has oversight and operational roles for conference‑related extrabudgetary resources (see PPB paragraphs on extrabudgetary trust funds and oversight). Thus this paragraph directs the Secretariat to create a fund whose oversight/administration and use for conference participation logistics would fall within activities DGACM implements (conference servicing, registration, trust‑fund oversight for conference management)."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 18 requests the Secretary‑General to submit a progress report to the General Assembly at its seventy‑fifth session entitled “Follow‑up to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and strengthening of UN‑Habitat”. DGACM’s PPB shows the Department is responsible for substantive and technical secretariat support and for preparation, processing and publication of Secretary‑General reports and parliamentary documentation for the General Assembly. Therefore this paragraph creates an implementation task for the Secretariat that DGACM will support (preparing, processing, issuing and making available the requested report)."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 19 decides that the General Assembly should include, at its seventy‑fifth session, an item entitled “Follow‑up to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and strengthening of UN‑Habitat” in its provisional agenda. Inclusion of a provisional agenda item is an action that the Secretariat (DGACM) implements in its role providing procedural secretariat services to the Assembly (preparing provisional agendas, agenda documentation and related secretariat follow‑up). Thus the paragraph imposes a concrete Secretariat task that DGACM’s PPB shows it carries out."

      "relevance_comment": "This operative paragraph explicitly addresses the interpretation and translation services provided by the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management: it recognizes operational challenges and 'encourages the Secretary-General to strengthen efforts to address these challenges, and engage with Member States and receive feedback on opportunities to enhance the quality and effectiveness of these services, for presentation to the General Assembly at its eightieth session.' Although the directive is to the Secretary-General, the PPB shows that DGACM is the entity responsible for delivering interpretation and translation (see mandates and subprogrammes on documentation, meetings and publishing services). Thus this paragraph creates an obligation for the Secretariat to take corrective action regarding services that DGACM implements and to present results to the Assembly, implying DGACM will be the implementing service and provide the technical input and follow-up called for."

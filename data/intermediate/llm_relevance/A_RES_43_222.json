This directs the Secretary‑General and the Committee on Conferences to engage with United Nations organs that have under‑utilized conference‑servicing resources so as to assist them to use those services better. The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) provides the Secretariat support to the Committee on Conferences and is the Organization’s conference‑servicing arm (see PPB paras. 2.1(c), 2.2 and subprogrammes on planning/coordination of conference services). DGACM would therefore be the operational entity to prepare and deliver the assistance, outreach and technical support called for by this paragraph (e.g., through planning, consultations, and service adjustments)."

This is an explicit request to the Secretary‑General to set documentation standards and guidance. DGACM’s PPB identifies its core responsibility for documentation, publishing and editorial standards (see PPB paras. 2.1(a),(c); subprogramme 3 and subprogramme 4 descriptions such as paras. 2.46 and 2.59). DGACM would therefore be the principal Secretariat service responsible for developing and implementing the standard format and editorial guidelines referenced in this paragraph."

DGACM provides substantive and technical secretariat support to the Committee on Conferences and to the organization and calendar of meetings (see PPB paras. 2.1(c), 2.20 and the Committee on Conferences terms noted in the PPB). DGACM would therefore be responsible for preparing and supplying the information the Secretary‑General is requested to submit."

Resolution 42/207 C and its follow‑up concern control/limitation of documentation and related Secretariat practices. DGACM’s mandate covers documentation management, publication policies and monitoring implementation of Assembly decisions on conference servicing and documentation (see PPB paras. 2.1, 2.14 and subprogramme 3 activities). While the paragraph addresses the Secretary‑General, DGACM would be the primary Secretariat unit responsible for carrying out the implementation measures and for supplying the reporting requested of the Secretary‑General."

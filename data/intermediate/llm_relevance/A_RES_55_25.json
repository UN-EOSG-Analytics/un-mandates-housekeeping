The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) provides conference servicing, documentation and publishing support for high‑level meetings (see PPB: provision of secretariat, documentation and publishing services), so DGACM would be the operational unit likely tasked by the Secretary‑General to produce or support preparation, processing and issuance of that report."

DGACM’s mandate includes planning, managing and servicing intergovernmental conferences and meetings (PPB: provision of procedural and technical secretariat support and conference‑servicing across duty stations), so DGACM would be responsible for implementing the convening logistics and related secretariat functions."

This is a direct instruction to ensure secretariat support; DGACM’s PPB explicitly assigns it responsibility for substantive and technical secretariat support and high‑quality conference‑servicing (see PPB 2.1(a),(c) and the subprogrammes on planning/coordination, documentation and meetings/publishing), meaning DGACM would implement this obligation."

This maps to DGACM’s operational responsibilities for arranging meetings and providing conference services (PPB: planning/coordination of conference services, meetings and publishing services, and provision of substantive/technical secretariat support), indicating DGACM would carry out these tasks."

      "relevance_comment": "Directs action: “Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session, under the item entitled ‘Sustainable development’, the sub-item entitled ‘Report of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme’.” This creates a concrete, procedural task to place that sub‑item on the General Assembly’s provisional agenda and to service it. Connection to DGACM PPB: DGACM is responsible for procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly (see PPB para. 2.1(a)) including preparing agendas, servicing meetings and associated documentation. Implementation of paragraph 65 would therefore be carried out by the Department through its agenda‑setting, documentation and conference‑servicing functions."

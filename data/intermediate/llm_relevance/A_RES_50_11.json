      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 1 requests the Secretary‑General to ensure strict implementation of resolutions establishing language arrangements. DGACM (the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management) is the Secretariat entity charged in its PPB with establishing and applying language arrangements, providing authoritative procedural/technical secretariat support and multilingual meeting and documentation services (see PPB paras 2.1(c),(d), 2.2–2.3). Thus this paragraph directs an action (implementation of language arrangements) that DGACM is responsible for carrying out on behalf of the Secretariat."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 3 requests the Secretary‑General to ensure staff appointments follow Article 101 and that recruits have command of at least one working language (and to encourage use of other official languages in promotions). DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department’s role in Secretariat‑wide coordination of multilingualism and in recruitment, training and replenishing language capacity (see PPB paras 2.3, 2.46(f),(g) and related sections on staffing and training). The paragraph thus creates an obligation for the Secretariat that DGACM is mandated to implement or support operationally."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 4 requests the Secretary‑General to ensure, in recruitment and promotion of Secretariat staff, equality of the working languages. DGACM is presented in the PPB as the system‑wide lead on multilingualism and is responsible for policies/standards and coordination (PPB paras 2.2–2.3), so this instruction to the Secretary‑General falls to DGACM to help implement in practice."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 9 urges delegations and the Secretariat to endeavour to avoid holding informal meetings without interpretation. This directly addresses the Secretariat’s conduct of meetings. DGACM’s PPB (subprogramme on meetings and interpretation: paras 2.59–2.60 and results/activities across subprogrammes 2 and 4) shows the Department is responsible for providing interpretation and meeting support, so the paragraph imposes an operational requirement DGACM would need to apply/advice on."

      "relevance_comment": "Operative para 10 requests the Secretary‑General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty‑second session on implementation of the resolution, particularly on use of official and working languages. DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department as Secretariat‑wide coordinator and system‑wide lead on multilingualism (PPB para 2.3) and describes its role in monitoring, evaluation and reporting on multilingual conference services. Preparing or contributing substantive material for such a report is therefore an implementation task falling to DGACM."

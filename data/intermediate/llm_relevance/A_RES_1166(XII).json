This directs the Secretary‑General to circulate a draft Convention; circulation and distribution of draft conventions and related parliamentary documentation are tasks that the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) implements in its PPB (publishing, documentation services, and distribution of material to Member States). Thus this paragraph creates an obligation on the Secretary‑General that DGACM would operationalize."

      "relevance_comment": "Specific operative instruction: “To circulate to Member States the text of the preamble and nineteen articles of the draft Convention.” This is an explicit direction to the Secretary‑General to disseminate a document to Member States. DGACM’s programme (documentation, publishing and distribution services; simultaneous issuance and circulation of parliamentary documentation) is the entity responsible for producing and circulating such material on behalf of the Secretary‑General, so this paragraph effectively mandates work DGACM carries out."

      "relevance_comment": "Directs the Secretary‑General to communicate, as soon as possible, the names (and any curricula vitae) of candidates submitted by Governments to Member States. This creates a Secretariat task to process and disseminate nominations; DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department as responsible for procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and for communication/administrative handling of intergovernmental business (see overall orientation and subprogramme responsibilities for secretariat support), so DGACM would implement this communicative/administrative function."

      "relevance_comment": "Requires the Secretary‑General to prepare the alphabetical list of duly nominated candidates and submit it to the General Assembly for election. Preparing and submitting electoral documentation and lists is an administrative/secretariat service; DGACM’s mandate and PPB (provision of procedural and technical secretariat support to the General Assembly and related bodies) indicate that the Department carries out such Secretariat tasks."

      "relevance_comment": "Directs the Secretary‑General to make available, so far as he is able, the staff and facilities required by the Commission to fulfil its task. This is an instruction to the Secretariat to provide staffing and facilities support; DGACM’s PPB explicitly assigns the Department responsibility for substantive and technical secretariat support, conference‑servicing facilities and related staffing arrangements, so DGACM would be responsible for implementing this provision."

      "paragraph_index": 109,
      "relevance_comment": "States that the Secretary‑General will provide, when necessary and within budget limits, for the expenses of consultations of experts (in connection with Commission work). This obliges the Secretariat to arrange and fund expert consultations and associated administrative arrangements; DGACM’s PPB shows the Department coordinates consultations, manages meeting support and administers related resources (programme support and conference services), indicating DGACM would implement these logistical and funding arrangements."

      "relevance_comment": "Provides that when the Commission considers a draft satisfactory it shall request the Secretary‑General to issue it as a Commission document and that the Secretariat shall give all necessary publicity to the document, with explanations and supporting material. This is a direct instruction to the Secretariat to publish, publicize and distribute Commission documents. DGACM’s PPB assigns documentation, publishing and distribution functions (subprogramme 3 and subprogramme 4) — simultaneous issuance, publication and dissemination — so DGACM would carry out these publication/distribution obligations."

      "relevance_comment": "Directs the Secretary‑General, after consultation with the Commission, to draw up a list of national and international organizations concerned with questions of international law for the purpose of distribution of Commission documents, and to endeavour to include at least one national organization of each Member. This tasks the Secretariat with preparing distribution networks/lists and distributing documents; DGACM’s PPB includes publishing, distribution and outreach functions (maintaining portals, distributing parliamentary documentation and outreach to organizations), linking this paragraph to DGACM implementation responsibility."

      "paragraph_index": 234,
      "relevance_comment": "Instructs the Secretary‑General to do the necessary preparatory work for the commencement of the Commission’s activity (preparatory Secretariat work, e.g., on items referred by the General Assembly such as the draft declaration on rights and duties of States). This is an instruction to the Secretariat to undertake preparatory administrative and substantive support; DGACM’s PPB identifies the Department as the provider of procedural and substantive secretariat support for the Assembly and its subsidiary bodies, so DGACM would be expected to implement this preparatory work."

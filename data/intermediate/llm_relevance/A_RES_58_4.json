This creates an obligation on the Secretariat to organize and convene the Conference — functions that DGACM’s programme budget explicitly covers (provision of procedural and technical secretariat support, conference planning and meeting services across duty stations; see overview and subprogramme descriptions, e.g., para. 2.1 (facilitation through provision of procedural and technical secretariat support) and subprogramme planning/coordination paragraphs such as 2.33). DGACM would be a primary implementing service for the practical arrangements and servicing needed to convene the Conference."

That is an explicit Secretariat mandate to deliver secretariat services for the Conference — tasks that fall within DGACM’s remit (DGACM provides substantive and technical secretariat support and conference services for United Nations conferences and intergovernmental bodies; see para. 2.1 and the subprogramme descriptions for documentation, meetings and conference management)."

This operationalizes the secretariat obligation into concrete servicing and arrangements for sessions — activities (meeting planning, conference‑servicing, documentation and logistical support) that DGACM’s PPB explicitly states it delivers (see para. 2.1(c), subprogramme strategies for planning and coordination of conference services (e.g., para. 2.33) and meetings/publishing services)."

This creates a specific secretariat support role for information handling and assistance to Member States — matching DGACM’s documentation, publishing and information‑services functions (subprogramme 3 and subprogramme 4 activities, and references to providing substantive/technical secretariat support and consolidated e‑services in paras. 2.1, 2.21, 2.46)."

      "relevance_comment": "Requires the secretariat to ensure the necessary coordination with the secretariats of relevant international and regional organizations. DGACM’s PPB notes its inter‑agency coordination and liaison role (e.g., para. 2.10 on chairing/participating in inter‑agency meetings and coordination on multilingualism and conference services) and its responsibility for coordinating conference servicing with other entities, so this paragraph assigns a coordination task that DGACM would be expected to implement as part of Secretariat support."

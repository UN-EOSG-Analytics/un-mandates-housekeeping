      "relevance_comment": "Paragraph 26 directs the Secretary‑General “to enable adequate institutional focus on the needs of small island developing States and provide effective support for the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States.” This is a directive to the Secretary‑General to provide conference-related support. The Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM) is the Secretariat entity responsible for conference services and substantive/technical secretariat support (see PPB: overall mandates in paras. 2.1(a), 2.1(c) and 2.1(d); planning and coordination of conference services, paras. 2.33, 2.72, 2.112, 2.152; and meetings/publishing services, paras. 2.59, 2.99, 2.139 and 2.178). Therefore DGACM would be expected to implement the Secretary‑General’s obligation in this paragraph by providing the planning, coordination, meeting servicing, documentation, interpretation, publishing and protocol support for that Conference."

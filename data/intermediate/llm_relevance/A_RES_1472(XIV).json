      "relevance_comment": "This paragraph “requests the Secretary‑General, in accordance with the conclusions of the Committee, to make the necessary organizational arrangements for holding the conference.” It is a direct request to the Secretary‑General to organize the conference. DGACM’s PPB shows the Department is the Secretariat unit responsible for conference management and for providing the technical and organizational arrangements and secretariat support for United Nations conferences and intergovernmental meetings (see, e.g., para. 2.1(c) on conference‑servicing and substantive/technical secretariat support; para. 2.33(a) on planning and managing meetings and documentation; and para. 2.59(a) on providing meeting support and publishing services). Therefore paragraph 43 creates an implementable task for the Department (as the service that the Secretary‑General would task to make the organizational arrangements)."

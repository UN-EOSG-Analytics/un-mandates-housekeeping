      "relevance_comment": "Directs the Secretary‑General to make provision for the sessions of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies in his proposal for the programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009. This is a mandate to the Secretary‑General to include resources for those sessions in the UN programme budget — resources that, according to DGACM’s PPB, would be used to plan, manage and deliver conference services and secretariat support (see PPB mandate and functions such as provision of technical and substantive secretariat support and conference‑servicing in paragraph 2.1(a),(c) and budget/programme provisions throughout subprogrammes). Therefore this paragraph creates an obligation on the Secretariat (via the Secretary‑General) to fund sessions that DGACM is responsible for implementing."

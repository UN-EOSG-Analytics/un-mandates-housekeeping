      "relevance_comment": "Paragraph 24 requests the Secretary‑General to make provisions for the sessions of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies in the proposed programme budget for the 2012–2013 biennium. That is an instruction to the Secretariat to include and resource those meetings in its budget submissions — a task that, in practice, DGACM implements through its conference‑management functions (planning and coordination of conference services, inclusion of meetings in the United Nations calendar, preparation of cost estimates and inputs to the programme budget). The Department’s PPB explicitly describes these responsibilities (e.g., provision of conference‑servicing and budgeting/coordination functions under subprogrammes 2 and programme support and the Department’s role in the UN calendar and budgetary provisions), so this paragraph creates an obligation that DGACM would be expected to operationalize."

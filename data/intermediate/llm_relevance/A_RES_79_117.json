This is a directive to the Secretary‑General on documentation policy that would be implemented by the Secretariat’s documentation and publishing services. DGACM’s PPB (subprogramme 3: Documentation services) explicitly states responsibility for delivering multilingual documentation services, applying quality/timeliness requirements and implementing documentation-related mandates, so this paragraph creates an obligation on the Secretary‑General that DGACM would operationalize (e.g., through how page limits are applied in document processing and issuance)."

Publication and provision of summary records fall within DGACM’s mandated functions (subprogramme 3: Documentation services; subprogramme 4: Meetings and publishing services), so this paragraph places a concrete task on the Secretary‑General that DGACM is responsible for implementing (i.e., continuing to publish Commission texts and to produce/provide summary records in the official languages)."

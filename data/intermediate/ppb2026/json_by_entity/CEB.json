The mandate of CEB derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly and Economic and Social Council resolutions and decisions, including Council resolution 13 (III) and decision 2001/321. At a time when the international community is confronted by increasingly complex and interrelated global challenges, coordinated and coherent action by the entities of the United Nations system is imperative. Mobilizing the system’s collective capacity is vital to supporting Member States in the integrated and accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Pact for the Future, as well as the full range of mandates entrusted to United Nations system entities.",

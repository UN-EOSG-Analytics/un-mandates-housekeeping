Survivors often opt not to lodge official complaints due to fear of reprisals, and the remoteness of their locations, which limits their access to health facilities and justice. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the United Nations Country Team and the Office of the Special Representative have provided sustained support to the authorities to hold perpetrators of sexual violence accountable and deliver justice to survivors. For instance, the United Nations supported the deployment of mobile courts to address criminal cases, including on sexual and gender-based violence, and conducted training sessions for legal professionals to strengthen the capacity of the administration of justice, access to legal support by women and protection of human rights. In addition, the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict trained police investigators and prosecutors to strengthen their capacity to effectively investigate and prosecute sexual and gender-based violence offences, aiming to promote accountability, combat impunity and deter potential perpetrators from committing further crimes. Furthermore, the South Sudan People's Defense Forces’ Military Justice Department received support to deploy 13 general court-martials to nine locations across South Sudan to adjudicate serious cases, including sexual violence crimes, committed by members of the armed forces against civilians.",

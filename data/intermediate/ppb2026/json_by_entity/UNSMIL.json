The review aimed to align staffing resources with mandate priorities and operational needs, and to assess the Mission support structure in line with the Department for Operational Support guidelines on Mission Support Structure for Small Missions. By its resolution 2755 (2024), the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit a strategic review of UNSMIL to the Council no later than 30 September 2025, including recommendations for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of UNSMIL’s overall structure, including the objectives of UNSMIL.  As the strategic review will be finalized after the 2026 proposed programme budget, the outcome of the staffing review is not reflected in the current proposed budget for 2026.

These positions include three Programme Management Officers (P-4), one Programme Management Officer (P-3), one Associate Programme Management Officer (National Professional Officer),  one Associate Administrative Officer (National Professional Officer), and one Data Analysis Officer (National Professional Officer).

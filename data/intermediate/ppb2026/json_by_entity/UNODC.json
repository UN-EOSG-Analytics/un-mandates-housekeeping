The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant United Nations conventions and General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 45/179, 46/152 and 46/185 C. The work of the Office is grounded in a series of conventions and other international instruments for which the Office acts as guardian and advocate. They include the three international drug control conventions, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the 19 international conventions and protocols against terrorism, the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, and the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes, adopted by the General Assembly on 24 December 2024. The thematic focus areas of the Office include addressing and countering the world drug problem, preventing and countering transnational organized crime, corruption and economic crime, terrorism and cybercrime, and undertaking crime prevention and criminal justice reform. UNODC supports Member States by facilitating multilateral cooperation and partnerships, by delivering technical assistance, by expanding the evidence base and by developing the capacity of Governments to formulate and implement coherent policies to address these issues.",

Precious metals and stones are often illegally mined and smuggled or misrepresented in trade transactions to obscure the origins of illegally gained funds. A form of trade-based money laundering, this manipulation enables criminals to launder money through legitimate trade channels by under-invoicing or falsifying trade records. Limited capacity to investigate such complex cases compounds the problem and allows these practices to thrive. At the same time, virtual assets, which offer anonymity and swift cross-border transfers, are used in conjunction with trade-based money laundering schemes, enabling criminals to further hide and move illicit profits across borders undetected. In combination, these methods amplify the challenge of curbing financial crime in Africa. The subprogramme developed tailored capacity-building programmes that benefit policymakers as well as officers of financial intelligence units and law enforcement and customs agencies, prosecutors and regulators to strengthen their capacities to regulate, understand, detect, investigate and prosecute these methods of money-laundering.",

For example, despite the ban imposed in April 2022, the trafficking of drugs originating from Afghanistan continues. Furthermore, cocaine production has reached record highs, while synthetic drugs have shorter production times and no fixed geography, and their illegal manufacture has expanded to low- and middle-income countries, including countries with a strong rule of law. The trafficking of other goods, including wildlife, timber, hazardous waste, precious minerals and firearms also remains a major concern. The subprogramme strengthens passenger and supply-chain security to prevent the trafficking of illicit goods through comprehensive and cohesive border management approaches.",

Globalization, a huge influx of money, the rapid growth of legal and illegal sports betting, and technological advances have transformed the way sport is played and consumed. Criminal groups exploit vulnerabilities linked to these changes and the weaknesses of legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern sport. In response, States have recognized the need to tackle corruption in sport in several resolutions adopted by the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Since 2018, the subprogramme has supported government and sports officials in implementing these resolutions by conducting awareness-raising activities, building capacities and enhancing cooperation to effectively prevent, detect, investigate and sanction corruption in sport at all levels. In 2024, following the multi-stakeholder conference on safeguarding sport from corruption for officials from sports organizations and criminal justice authorities in South Asia, held in 2023, the subprogramme took follow-up actions such as a workshop for investigators and prosecutors. As a result, Sri Lankan investigators and prosecutors conducted a high-profile investigation into the manipulation of cricket matches, which led to the indictment of criminals.",

In-depth femicide reviews offer an opportunity to identify limitations of existing responses to gender-based violence against women, as well as opportunities for cross-sector collaboration aimed at ending all forms of violence against women and girls. The subprogramme convened a global expert group meeting in 2023 and regional consultations in South Africa in 2024 on femicide review committees. The meetings, informed by the UNODC background paper on femicide review committees, gathered justice, health and social sector professionals, along with activists from civil society organizations supporting families affected by femicide, to exchange experiences and explore opportunities to establish femicide review committees in their countries. Partnering with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences, WHO and the United Nations Population Fund further bolstered global action against femicide by pooling resources and maximizing the outreach.",

Moreover, the subprogramme introduced innovative educational materials, such as the manual on child-sensitive psychosocial assessment and the research study on child recruitment and exploitation by terrorist groups in Indonesia, Iraq and Nigeria. The materials were designed to foster resilience and critical thinking among children, and sensitized training professionals on preventing the recruitment and exploitation of children by terrorist groups.

Trafficking reduces wildlife populations and can disrupt ecosystems and affect climate resilience. It also threatens socioeconomic benefits that people derive from nature, such as income, food and medicine, and undermines governance by fostering corruption and illicit financial flows. Understanding the scale, geographical scope and trends of wildlife trafficking is key for effective policy formulation and law enforcement responses at the national and international levels. The subprogramme contributed to these efforts by collecting and analysing wildlife seizures data provided by Member States and complemented by other sources, and by providing global and thematic analyses based on these records. As at 2024, UNODC had collated over 140,000 seizure records from 162 countries and territories, dated between 2015 and 2021. On the basis of this data, the subprogramme compiled the 2024 World Wildlife Crime Report, which found signs of progress in reducing trafficking of some iconic species, such as elephants and rhinoceroses. For these species, a combination of preventive efforts on both the demand and supply sides has produced positive outcomes. However, the available evidence did not provide confidence that wildlife trafficking is being substantially reduced overall.",

In addition, based on the dialogue with stakeholders undertaken in the context of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, stakeholders acknowledged that effectively addressing cybercrime required collaborative efforts among diverse actors. Through the Global Programme on Cybercrime and the Cybercrime Stakeholder Engagement Initiative, the subprogramme brought together representatives from the public and private sectors, civil society, and international and regional organizations to discuss collaborative strategies for preventing and responding to cybercrime in the context of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime. Participants explored areas of cooperation and approaches that contribute to developing new and strengthening existing multi-stakeholder collaboration in fighting cybercrime as well as to identifying needs and opportunities for future action.",

Following several consultations by the Commission and the Secretary-General with the Fifth and Sixth Committees of the General Assembly, the Assembly, in its resolution 77/256 A, decided to amend articles 10 and 11 of the statute of the Commission and reaffirmed the authority and competence of the Commission to establish post adjustment multipliers for duty stations in the United Nations common system, under article 11 (c) of the statute. The Assembly, in the same resolution, invited common system organizations to complete, as quickly as practicable, formal acceptance of the amended statute and called upon all organizations that had not done so to implement the post adjustment multipliers established by the Commission, based on the results of the 2021 baseline cost-of-living surveys. The Commission engaged closely with common system organizations to promote implementation of the Assembly’s decisions. By the end of 2024, 24 out of 28 organizations had formally adopted the changes to the Commission’s statute.",

The passage of time and the emergence of new ethical challenges have created a need for clearer standards in relation to contacts outside the common system and more transparent accountability systems. The standards were reissued in 1986 and revised in 1998, 2001 and 2012. In 2022, the Commission decided to revise the current standards to ensure that they continued to meet the needs of the organizations. The focus was on external interactions, including political activities and conflict of interest; internal issues such as abuse of authority, harassment, all forms of violence, strengthening of accountability, duty of care and staff-management relations; and emerging issues. The Commission created a working group comprising staff, organizations and the Commission and will present the changes in its 2025 annual report, for roll-out in 2026.",

In the light of the ongoing significant financial constraints faced by United Nations system entities, in January 2025 the Network issued guidance to the jointly financed activities entities in formulating their 2026 budget proposals, noting that it was imperative that the 2026 budget formulation process reflect fiscal prudence and align with the financial realities of contributing organizations. To enable informed decision-making and flexibility in addressing financial constraints, the Network requested each jointly financed activities entity to submit to it two budget scenarios for 2026: one at zero growth and one with a 20 per cent reduction compared with the 2025 approved budget levels, with the caveat that if there were no vacant posts, the 20 per cent reduction might be applied to non-post resources only. That two-scenario approach was intended to enhance awareness among jointly financed activities entities of the financial challenges faced by contributing agencies, while ensuring a transparent, consultative and impact-driven decision-making process for the 2026 budgets. The Network reviewed the budget proposed by the Commission for 2026 and welcomed an initial proposal for a 5 per cent reduction, the Commission having indicated that achieving the requested 20 per cent reduction would be challenging without compromising its core functions. The Network nevertheless noted that there were clear opportunities for further reductions, including with respect to vacant posts in the Commission secretariat and with regard to travel, and requested the Commission to take the most prudent measures possible in finalizing the 2026 budget proposal for consideration by the General Assembly. The proposed resources for 2026 that are shown in the present budget submission are at the same level as those approved for 2025, as finalized by the Commission, with cost-neutral redeployments of resources mainly from general operating expenses to contractual services and travel of representatives.",

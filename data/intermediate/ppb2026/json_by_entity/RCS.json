Therefore, a continuance of the commitment authority with assessment would supplement any funding gaps in the special purpose trust fund. The distribution of the resources is reflected in tables 1.151 and 1.152. Under the locally mobilized resources, the resident coordinator system anticipates $8 million of earmarked contributions to be received at the country level for activities financed by third parties that are mobilized locally for activities that go beyond the core focus of the special purpose trust fund (reflected in table 1.151 below under country coordination component).",

This increase is offset by corresponding decreases under non-post resources. The net decrease of $164,900 under non-post resources comprises: (i) a redeployment of $43,600 from other staff costs to posts for the Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator position in Nigeria (representing the cost differential between D-2 and Assistant Secretary-General levels previously budgeted as general temporary assistance); and (ii) a reduction of $128,700 under general operating expenses, due to lower operational requirements across country offices and a redeployment of $7,400 to contractual services to accommodate anticipated increases in Information Technology service costs.",

The branches and sections also provide strategic guidance to United Nations country teams for joint analysis, planning, programming, monitoring and assessment of United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks, as well as guidance for joint communications and advocacy on the Sustainable Development Goals and the advancement of system-wide operational efficiencies. Responsibilities under global coordination are implemented by two branches and two sections: the Policy and Programming Branch, the Resident Coordinator System Leadership Branch, the Country Business Strategies Section and the Communications and Results Reporting Section.

The proposed staffing for 2026 includes an upward reclassification of the resident coordinator post in Nigeria from D-2 to Assistant Secretary-General level; an increase of one post at the Assistant Secretary-General level in Somalia for the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator function beginning November 2026, following the anticipated closure of the United Nations Transitional Assistance Mission in Somalia; and an increase of one post at the D-2 level in Iraq for the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator function, following the closure of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq from September 2026. Previously, the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator posts in Iraq and Somalia were reflected as cost-shared triple-hatted Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (DSRSG/RC/HC) posts.",

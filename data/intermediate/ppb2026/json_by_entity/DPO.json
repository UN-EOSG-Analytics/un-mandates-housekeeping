The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including the Pact for the Future (resolution 79/1) and resolution 72/262 C, the annual comprehensive reviews of the entire question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects and the annual consideration of cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations. The objectives of the programme are also conceived by taking into account Security Council mandates. The Department provides integrated strategic, political, operational and management advice, direction and support on military, police, mine action and other relevant issues to all operations under its responsibility in order to ensure the effective implementation of their mandates. Through its efforts to improve peacekeeping, enhance its performance and adapt to contemporary risks and challenges, the Department will continue to help conflict-affected countries on their path back to sustainable peace. The work of the Department is critical to continuously ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping, which remains a vital instrument for international peace and security",

The working group provided a report with key findings and recommended the development of a guidance document on the use of temporary operating bases in field missions. In June 2024, new guidelines on the management of temporary operating bases in United Nations peacekeeping missions were promulgated, covering the entire life cycle of temporary operating bases, from establishment to closure, and including a tailored logistics support concept for specific scenarios.",

The use of misleading or manipulated information about a peacekeeping mission can affect its credibility, access to vulnerable populations, standing within political processes and capacity to operate safely. Hate speech by parties to conflict and by communities within host States can inflame intergroup tensions and undermine peace processes, increasing threats to civilians and imperilling efforts to achieve durable political settlements. The subprogramme has developed a comprehensive training package integrating conceptual, legal and operational frameworks to equip military and police commanders and personnel with the knowledge and skills to analyse these threats. The training package serves to establish a foundation for the implementation of proactive risk mitigation measures to maintain operational capability and ensure the safety and security of personnel.",

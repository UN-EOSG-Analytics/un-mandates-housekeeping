The General Assembly, in its resolution 70/286, and the Security Council, by its resolution 2272 (2016), welcomed the appointment of the Special Coordinator and the Secretary-General’s continued efforts to implement and reinforce the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, in particular to strengthen the Organization’s prevention, reporting, enforcement and remedial action in order to promote greater accountability. In its resolution 71/278, the Assembly welcomed the continued efforts of the Secretary-General to combat sexual exploitation and abuse, including the appointment of a Special Coordinator on improving the United Nations response to sexual exploitation and abuse and the establishment of a high-level task force to develop, as a matter of urgency, a clear, game-changing strategy to achieve visible and measurable improvements in the Organization’s approach to preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse. The Assembly also expressed its support to the Secretary-General, the Office and all relevant departments in their efforts to implement the zero-tolerance policy and, in particular, to strengthen the Organization’s prevention, reporting, enforcement and response mechanisms in order to promote greater accountability, and in that regard requested the Secretary-General to continue to work in close consultation with Member States for the effective implementation of the policy.",

In applying the lesson, the Office will prioritize strategic resource planning and advocate for sustained financial commitments and mechanisms. Efforts will also focus on embedding protection from sexual exploitation and abuse into governance structures, leadership frameworks, and accountability mechanisms, moving beyond the current ad hoc programming and initiatives. Strengthening coordination, policy alignment, committed leadership and systematic implementation will be central to this shift.",

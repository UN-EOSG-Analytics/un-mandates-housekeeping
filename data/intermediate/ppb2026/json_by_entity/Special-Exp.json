The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to continue to validate the accrued liabilities with the figures audited by the Board of Auditors and to include that information and the outcome of the validation in the requested report. The report of the Secretary-General on managing after-service health insurance liabilities (A/68/353) was submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. The Assembly, in its resolution 68/244, endorsed the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the continuation of the pay-as-you-go approach to the funding of the after-service health insurance liabilities. It also requested the Secretary-General to examine the option of broadening the mandate of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, to include the cost-effective, efficient and sustainable administration of after-service health insurance benefits, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of that option, including its financial and legal implications, and to report thereon at the seventieth session of the Assembly, as well as to undertake a survey of current health-care plans for active and retired staff within the United Nations system, to explore options to increase efficiency and contain costs and to report thereon at its seventieth session. In his report on managing after-service health insurance (A/73/662), informed in large part by the work of the inter-agency Working Group on After-Service Health Insurance, the Secretary-General continued to apprise the Assembly of the work undertaken in response to its request. In its resolution on managing after-service health insurance (resolution 73/279 B), the Assembly endorsed the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee (A/73/792), including that the Secretary-General further explore options for the improvement of efficiency and the containment of costs, including liabilities associated with current and future staff, with a view to reducing the Organization’s expenditure on health insurance plans and its after-service health insurance obligations.",

The United Nations Offices at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, as well as the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok, separately maintain property and liability coverage for their offices locally. General insurance also covers automobile liability insurance at Headquarters, liability insurance for aircraft used for travel by the Secretary-General but not owned by the United Nations, and insurance for other air travel of staff. In addition, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 41/210, the United Nations has established a self-insurance plan for general liability risk in respect of acts occurring in the Headquarters district in New York. The provisions also cover a stand-alone insurance policy for acts of terrorism, which, following the events of 11 September 2001, was established effective 2003 as a result of limitations in the scope of insurance coverage for risks, such as acts of terrorism that would normally have been covered under the general policies.",

Some limitations in the scope of insurance coverage, however, continue to be prevalent. Two such examples are the flood coverage restrictions introduced in the wake of storm Sandy in New York and the continued requirement for specific insurance for acts of terrorism. Actual premiums will be driven by the United Nations claims experience for previous years, and by the general state of insurance markets at the time of the renewal of the policy. The damages sustained by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (currently estimated at $6 million) to its building and the contents thereof as a result of the explosion in Beirut on 4 August 2020 and other property losses continue to have an impact on the property insurance renewal premium. In addition to loss history, insurance premiums are also affected by market conditions and capacity, that is, the number of underwriters in the marketplace willing to insure the risk at the time of renewal, inflation and reinsurance costs. The insurance marketplace is constantly evolving on the basis of global economic conditions, natural and human-made disasters or regulatory requirements, and insurers’ perception of specific risks relating to the United Nations.",

The Department is the lead entity of the United Nations for good offices, political analysis, mediation, electoral assistance, peacebuilding support and political guidance as they relate to the Organization’s efforts towards, inter alia, preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacebuilding and sustaining peace. The Department oversees the work of missions under its responsibility, including special envoys and regional offices. It also provides support to peacekeeping operations in the areas of mediation, electoral assistance and peacebuilding, as well as to resident coordinators. It provides substantive support and secretariat services to the Security Council and its subsidiary bodies, as well as to relevant subsidiary organs of the General Assembly, including the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. The Department also provides strategic, substantive and technical support to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission, manages the Peacebuilding Fund on behalf of the Secretary-General and draws together the expertise of the United Nations system to facilitate coherent system-wide action in support of peacebuilding and sustaining peace and to build on linkages to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",

The proliferation of the number and intensity of conflicts over the past few years and their immense human and material cost confirms the importance of conflict prevention and resolution through inclusive political solutions, peacebuilding and sustaining peace. In view of its comprehensive mandate, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs plays a central role in the implementation of several actions set out by Member States in the Pact for the Future (Assembly resolution 79/1), including in relation to: (a) the pacific settlement of disputes (action 16), in particular, urging the Secretary-General to actively use his good offices and ensure that the United Nations is adequately equipped to lead and support mediation and preventive diplomacy; (b) building and sustaining peace (action 18), including provision of assistance to States, upon their request, in full conformity with national ownership and needs, to build national capacity to promote, develop and implement their nationally owned prevention efforts and address the root causes of violence and conflict in their countries; (c) accelerating the implementation of commitments on women and peace and security (action 19); (d) accelerating the implementation of commitments on youth and peace and security (action 20); and (e) adapting peace operations to better respond to existing challenges and new realities (action 21).",

In addition, the Department supports the efforts of the Peacebuilding Commission to mainstream a gender perspective in all aspects of its work, including through the implementation of the Commission’s gender strategy and by keeping track of progress through the submission of annual reports.

The mandate derives from the priorities established in General Assembly resolutions and/or decisions, including resolutions 62/214, 71/278, 71/297, 75/321, 76/274, 77/333 and 78/331. The centrepiece of the strategy is to put the rights and dignity of victims at the centre of the work to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse across the United Nations system. The Victims’ Rights Advocate has a system-wide role, with her advocacy and action extending to peacekeeping, humanitarian and development settings. At Headquarters, she is supported by the Office of the Victims’ Rights Advocate. In the field, her mandate is operationalized through Senior Victims’ Rights Officers in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and South Sudan.",

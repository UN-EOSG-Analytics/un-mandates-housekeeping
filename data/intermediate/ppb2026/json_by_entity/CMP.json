In addition, following an agreement between the leaders of both Cypriot communities, the Committee was entrusted with a new role as of 2006: to investigate and excavate unknown burial sites, to recover and identify the remains of missing persons and then to hand them over to their families across the island for dignified burials. As of the end of January 2025, the Committee had exhumed 1,699 persons and identified and returned the remains of 1,052 missing persons to their families, or 52.5 per cent of all missing persons in Cyprus. It has also identified and returned the remains of 216 persons who are not on the Committee’s official list. As time passes, the Committee has increased its efforts to locate more burial sites by hiring and training new investigators and investing in modern technologies.",

The office of the third member ensures the smooth running of the bicommunal component of the Committee project that employs more than 100 locally recruited Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot professionals. Over the past few years, the United Nations office of the Committee has liaised with other commissions and committees globally that work on missing persons cases and has organized numerous visits and training events for visiting scientists and policymakers every year. The Committee is in the process of constructing a dedicated conference room to better accommodate such visits. This new training centre is expected to be fully operational in 2026.",

The sanctions regime is the most comprehensive and complex of all United Nations sanctions regimes in effect and aims to ensure that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea abandons all nuclear weapons and its existing nuclear programme, as well as any other existing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. The regime includes 26 sanctions measures. In addition to an arms embargo and an embargo relating to nuclear, ballistic missile and other weapons of mass destruction programmes, a travel ban and/or asset freeze on designated individuals and entities, it includes a range of maritime provisions for designating vessels for involvement in prohibited activities and restrictions on various commodity transfers, such as refined petroleum products, minerals, metals, heavy machinery, transportation vehicles, luxury goods, seafood, textiles and more. It also includes restrictions on transportation and on financial services, as well as on overseas workers. Furthermore, to ensure that the measures that it imposed do not have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population, the Security Council adopted a wide range of humanitarian and other exemptions.",

It was also important to raise awareness of the sanctions measures and promote compliance by encouraging Member States to report on their national implementation of the sanctions measures and responding to requests for guidance from various sanctions implementation partners, including Member States, and UN and other humanitarian actors. In applying the lesson, the mission will strengthen its outreach activities by engaging Member States and other stakeholders. This will be achieved, inter alia, through open and regional group briefings, special meetings on important thematic and regional topics and implementation challenges faced by Member States.",

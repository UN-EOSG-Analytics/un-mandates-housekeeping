The initiative consisted of five informative videos covering the following five topics: (a) flexible working arrangements; (b) education grant; (c) rest and recuperation; (d) danger pay; and (e) home leave. The videos were carefully designed to address common challenges that staff members face and were published on the internal client support portal. The videos provide concise, accessible and clear explanations of entitlement processes for staff members, with 91 per cent of staff respondents to a client satisfaction survey who watched one of the videos indicating that they found them helpful.",

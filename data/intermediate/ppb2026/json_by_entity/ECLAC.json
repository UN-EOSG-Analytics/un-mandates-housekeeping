The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, as well as Economic and Social Council resolution 106 (VI), by which the Council established the Commission for the purpose of contributing to and coordinating action towards the economic and social development of the region and reinforcing economic relationships among the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and with other regions of the world. In 1996, pursuant to ECLAC resolution 553 (XXVI), the Commission decided, inter alia, to collaborate with member States in the comprehensive analysis of development processes geared towards the design, monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information, advisory services, training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination. The support delivered by the Commission to member States is also provided through the regular programme of technical cooperation and Development Account projects. In Assembly resolution 79/1 on the Pact for the Future, Member States reiterated their commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and recognized that all developing countries required assistance to implement the Agenda. The Commission remains uniquely positioned to support its member States in this regard.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will tailor its technical support to strengthen national capacities to accelerate the energy transition through the promotion of national initiatives such as policies and instruments, energy planning, the assessment of investment needs and methodologies that can be replicated or scaled up. The subprogramme will also promote technical, operative, political and prospective capacities, strengthen multi-stakeholder dialogues and produce evidence about the multi-dimensional benefits of the energy transition paths to support new initiatives in energy transition in the countries of the region.",

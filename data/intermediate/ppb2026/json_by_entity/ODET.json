The position of Envoy on Technology was established in 2021 to advise the senior leadership of the United Nations on key trends in technology, so as to guide the strategic approach taken by the Organization on such issues, to serve as an advocate and focal point for digital cooperation so that Member States, the technology industry, civil society and other stakeholders would have a first port of call for the broader United Nations system, and to facilitate multi-stakeholder policy dialogue on emerging technologies (see A/74/821). The establishment of the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology was noted by the General Assembly in its resolution 75/316.",

Lastly, in response to evaluation findings on the project in the Sahel region, the strategy of the OHCHR West Africa regional office has been updated to integrate considerations related to migration and climate change. Consistent with the formative approach of evaluations in OHCHR, the organizational learning derived from these evaluations have informed not only the country and regional presences where the evaluations took place, but also overall strategic programme directions.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will provide hands-on, context-specific advice to Member States, international organizations and businesses, upon request, to develop, use and govern technology in line with human rights norms and standards. A key measure in this regard will be the establishment of an advisory service on digital technologies and human rights, as recognized in the Global Digital Compact, which will support Member States and other stakeholders in areas such as legislation and regulation, as well as how to design large-scale digital infrastructure projects.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will provide hands-on, context-specific advice to Member States, international organizations and businesses, upon request, to develop, use and govern technology in line with human rights norms and standards. A key measure in this regard will be the establishment of an advisory service on digital technologies and human rights, as recognized in the Global Digital Compact, which will support Member States and other stakeholders in areas such as legislation and regulation, as well as how to design large-scale digital infrastructure projects.",

For example, the subprogramme provided advice in the negotiation process for the Global Digital Compact and for the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime. In addition, in 2024, pursuant to the abovementioned resolution, the subprogramme prepared a report for consideration by the Council (A/HRC/56/45) mapping the work and recommendations of the Council, OHCHR, the human rights treaty bodies and the special procedures of the Council in the field of human rights and new and emerging digital technologies, including artificial intelligence. The subprogramme also finalized the development of the Guidance of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Due Diligence for Digital Technology Use and convened an expert consultation on applying the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to the activities of technology companies.",

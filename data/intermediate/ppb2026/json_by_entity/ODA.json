Its mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including the final document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was the first special session devoted to disarmament (resolution S-10/2). Weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, remain the primary concern owing to their unparalleled destructive potential. The evolving global strategic environment has heightened the urgency of addressing emerging biosecurity risks, including through improving processes to anticipate, prevent, coordinate and respond to such risks, as well as bolstering the norm against chemical weapons. The Office provides support for national and international efforts to combat, prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which remain a significant driver of armed violence and conflict, and to reduce safety and security risks in through-life conventional ammunition management. The Office also supports States’ efforts to address emerging issues, including developments in science and technology, and their impact on international security.",

The Working Group was mandated, inter alia, to develop mechanisms for scientific and technological review and for international cooperation and assistance, with a view to establishing such mechanisms. In 2024, the Group made progress towards establishing the mechanisms through substantive discussions, which were informed by intersessional work undertaken by the Friends of the Chair to develop potential recommendations for their establishment. Intersessional work will continue in 2025, with a view to the adoption of the recommendations during the year. The establishment of the mechanisms would contribute to the strengthening of the Convention and ultimately help to safeguard humanity from the risks posed by biological weapons.",

The road map is focused on strengthening norms and institutional coordination; preventing armed violence and the misuse of firearms; managing the life cycle of weapons, ammunition and accessories; and investigating and criminally prosecuting illicit trafficking, possession and use of arms and ammunition. With sustained support from the international community, the road map will provide effective, sustainable and comprehensive mechanisms for enhancing arms control and ammunition management by bringing together States, promoting information-sharing and mobilizing resources to address urgent challenges.",

Under the strategic guidance of the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs and with the engagement of all programme managers, a review was carried out for each component of the Office against the backdrop of a growing global need for disarmament, the rapid pace of scientific and technological advances in this field, the proliferation of conventional arms and rising military expenditure, and the critical need to fulfil long-standing commitments to nuclear disarmament amid increasing nuclear risks. The review also built on previous efforts undertaken by the Office aimed at achieving operational efficiency, including the changes presented and subsequently approved in the proposed programme budget for 2022 (A/76/6 (Sect. 4)), which resulted in the downward classification of two senior-level posts (1 D-2 to D-1 and 1 P-5 to P-4) and the upward reclassification of one P-2 post to P-3.",

Instead of having two separate teams, the fellowship programme would be supported by a unified team of six staff (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 General Service (Principal Level) and 3 National Professional Officer), resulting in the proposed abolishment of two posts (2 National Professional Officer) in the regional centres and a commensurate decrease of $152,800 under posts. In respect of non-post resources, the synergies created through the consolidation of the fellowship training programmes, including by finding lower costs for the delivery of training services and travel of fellows, would result in a total reduction of $308,600 ($37,800 under contractual services, $258,000 under grants and contributions and $12,800 under non-post costs associated with the abolished posts, comprising $4,600 under contractual services, $4,800 under general operating costs, $400 under supplies and materials, and $3,000 under furniture and equipment).",

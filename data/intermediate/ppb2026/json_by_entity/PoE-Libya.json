The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 1973 (2011), 2009 (2011) and 2017 (2011), and renewed by its subsequent resolutions, including, most recently, 2769 (2025). The sanctions regime is aimed at preventing and containing threats to the peace, security and stability of Libya, including obstructing or undermining the successful completion of the political transition. In its resolution 2733 (2024), the Council requested the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya within 6 months and 11 months of the adoption of the resolution. The Secretary-General submitted his first report on 26 November 2024 (S/2024/858), while the second report was submitted on 25 April 2025 (S/2025/257).",

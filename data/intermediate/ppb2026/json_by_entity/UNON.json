In its resolution 53/242, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to strengthen the Office and encouraged the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi to take steps to increase the level of utilization of the Office. The Office was established to strengthen the United Nations presence in Nairobi and to achieve economies of scale, and provides management, information and communications technology (ICT) and administrative services to the United Nations complex in Nairobi. Under a memorandum of understanding and specific service arrangements, the Office provides the Nairobi-based headquarters and globally dispersed offices of UNEP and UN-Habitat with a full range of administrative and other support services. As a designated global and regional service provider, the Office provides human resources administration, payroll and finance services, international travel, recruitment of consultants and procurement services to the resident coordinator system and to Secretariat offices with a regional presence, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, the United Nations information centres in the Africa region and the International Court of Justice. In total, the Office provides services to United Nations entities in 166 countries. With the introduction of the Kenya Common Back Office, the United Nations Office at Nairobi provides administrative, ICT, local procurement and local recruitment services to more than 80 offices of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes operating in or from Kenya and other United Nations system entities, including special political missions and peacekeeping support operations operating from Kenya. In 2024, the United Nations Children’s Fund initiated a relocation of some of its staff with global functions to Nairobi from New York, the United Nations Office for Project Services relocated its Regional Office for Africa from Copenhagen to Nairobi and OHCHR strengthened its presence in Nairobi.",

As part of the subprogramme’s reforestation strategy, the original dry upland forest environment is being restored in as much of the complex as possible through the planting of over 34 species of indigenous biodiversity-supporting trees. This reforestation strategy has already reached the milestone of 2,806 trees planted by 2024. The strategy also simplifies the maintenance of the 140-acre complex, as large lawned areas require extensive irrigation during dry seasons and mowing during and after rainy seasons. Moreover, experience has shown that shade from trees is far more effective at protecting and cooling outdoor areas, staff, vehicles and buildings, and that moisture in the soil is retained for longer in shaded areas.",

As a short-term risk mitigation measure aimed at ensuring business continuity, conference room 1 will undergo a partial technology upgrade in 2025, and the equipment released from this project will be used to maintain the other large conference rooms before the next major event, the seventh session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, and the numerous other conferences taking place until 2029.",

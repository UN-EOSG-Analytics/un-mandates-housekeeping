This mandate has been confirmed and consolidated through the normative developments of various resolutions over the past 33 years. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is responsible for ensuring the timely, coherent, coordinated and principled response of the international community to natural disasters and complex emergencies and for facilitating the transition from emergency relief to rehabilitation and sustainable development. With over 305 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2025 and extreme poverty and hunger on the rise, owing to the compounded effects of emerging and prolonged armed conflicts and the crisis of climate change, ensuring well-coordinated and principled humanitarian assistance by the international community remains as important as ever.",

Through a series of virtual interactive sessions, participants discussed the most pressing challenges facing humanitarian assistance efforts and explored new pathways to enhance the system’s ability to adapt to change and respond. The theme of the 2024 Policy Forum underscored the urgent need to rethink and reshape humanitarian strategies in response to increasingly complex challenges and escalating levels of humanitarian need. It concluded with the development of actionable recommendations for humanitarian agencies, donors and partners, including to further promote community-driven approaches to humanitarian action, scale up climate action, depoliticize humanitarian assistance and foster strategic, inclusive leadership.",

In 2024, the United Nations and over 2,000 partner organizations reached nearly 116 million people with at least one form of assistance. This was despite the fact that humanitarians and the services they provide came under unprecedented attack in 2024, which was the most dangerous year on record for humanitarian personnel, with 356 humanitarians killed. Local humanitarian personnel, who serve their own communities on the front lines of conflict, are the most exposed to violence. Between January and November 2024, 96 per cent of all humanitarian personnel killed, injured or kidnapped were national or local staff. Despite focused response plans and appeals, funding did not keep pace with requirements in 2024. Just 46 per cent of the amount required according to the Global Humanitarian Overview was received.

The subprogramme is using predictive data to take action before disasters strike, through the establishment of pre-agreed anticipatory action frameworks under which predefined humanitarian interventions are triggered when specific forecasts indicate a high likelihood of a shock. This allows for a faster and more effective response by releasing pre-arranged funding, with a view to mitigating the impact before the crisis fully unfolds. Further scaling up of anticipatory approaches and early warning early action systems is needed, including through the consistent use of anticipatory financing mechanisms to ensure timely and predictable funding. In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will scale up anticipatory approaches and early warning early action systems to cover more countries and hazards, including through increased financing by humanitarian pooled funds for the coordination of such approaches.",

On 1 July 2024, Hurricane Beryl struck Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a category 4 hurricane, before intensifying to a category 5. The subprogramme promptly deployed staff and United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams to Barbados and Jamaica. Funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund was also allocated to enable the United Nations and its partners to swiftly deliver life-saving aid. The Joint Environment Unit of the United Nations Environment Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs deployed two specialists in environmental assessment and coordination within the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams. The teams established On-Site Operations Coordination Centres in Carriacou, Grenada, and Union, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, to facilitate a coordinated response. The International Humanitarian Partnership deployed from Barbados to Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to support local responders, emergency management authorities, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, as the regional response mechanism, and the private sector. The subprogramme also laid the groundwork for assessing the scale of destruction, damage and humanitarian needs. In collaboration with partners, the subprogramme developed and launched a response plan, amounting to $9 million, to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to 43,000 people. In addition, at the request of the affected Governments for assistance, the Joint Environment Unit responded to environmental emergencies arising from sudden-onset and complex emergencies in such countries as Ethiopia, Seychelles and Yemen.",

Its editorial team monitors and collects information from more than 4,000 key sources, including humanitarian agencies at the international and local levels, governments, think tanks and research institutions, and the media. Editors select, classify, curate and deliver the content that is most relevant to global humanitarian workers and decision makers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, enabling them to make informed decisions and to plan effective responses. To further enhance access to critical information, in July 2024, the subprogramme launched a tool powered by artificial intelligence, Ask ReliefWeb, which is designed to improve the user experience by allowing users to ask questions about individual reports through a chatbot-like interface. By providing precise answers sourced exclusively from the selected report, Ask ReliefWeb has served to streamline information retrieval, enabling humanitarian actors to quickly access the insights they need by posing simple, targeted questions. This advancement allows humanitarian actors to act more swiftly and effectively, translating critical data into meaningful action on the ground.",

In addition, overlapping information services were found to reduce clarity and add to the workload of stakeholders in humanitarian action. Furthermore, owing to the speed and complexity of humanitarian emergencies, real-time information-sharing among humanitarian actors is increasingly required. In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will consolidate existing information services to create a more coherent information management system. The subprogramme will lead the standardization of platforms used internally and by its partners to ensure interoperability and consistency in data management and reporting. The subprogramme will also implement automated data exchange protocols to facilitate real-time information-sharing among humanitarian actors. This will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of data, reducing manual entry errors and delays, and ultimately improving the responsiveness of humanitarian operations.",

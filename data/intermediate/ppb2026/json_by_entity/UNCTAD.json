This task is more critical than ever, in the light of the multiple current crises, the uneven impacts left behind by the pandemic and the fast changes driven by technological advancements and shifting political landscapes. The Bridgetown Covenant, the outcome document of the fifteenth quadrennial session of UNCTAD, contains calls for UNCTAD to counter the negative impact of the pandemic on the global economy and trade and to help developing countries to transform their economies through diversification, sustainability and resilience, to transform how development is financed and to strengthen multilateralism. Special attention is called for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States, African countries, other structurally weak, vulnerable and small economies, and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, while also taking account of the challenges facing middle-income countries. The Covenant also contains a reaffirmation of the role of UNCTAD as the focal point within the United Nations system for the integrated treatment of trade and development and interrelated issues in the areas of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development. UNCTAD will also respond to a number of underlying issues for sustainable, inclusive and equitable growth and development, as mandated in the Bridgetown Covenant.",

Therefore, fostering more inclusive and sustainable development and enhancing resilience to these challenges will continue to guide the work of UNCTAD, in accordance with the particular needs and challenges of the member States and the Bridgetown Covenant. In line with its mandate, UNCTAD will continue to rely on its three interrelated pillars of work: (a) conducting high-quality and evidence-based research and policy analysis that contribute to national, regional and international policies with the aim of generating inclusive and sustainable development under the principle of leaving no one behind; (b) providing technical cooperation to developing countries on the basis of such analysis; and (c) bringing member States together through its intergovernmental machinery to build consensus on policies that allow developing countries to maximize the opportunities of globalization and economic integration, as well as to address cross-cutting economic, social and environmental challenges.",

Mounting debt in low-income, and many middle-income, developing countries remains a major obstacle to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Servicing debt also constrains the ability of many developing countries to adapt to climate change and transform into low-emission economies. UNCTAD will thus continue addressing debt vulnerability and the high cost of debt, while also strengthening its support relating to how trade, investment and technology can support diversification and help the transition towards a low emission, competitive and climate-resilient and sustainable economy. UNCTAD will remain committed to addressing interrelated issues essential to all countries in attaining sustainable and equitable growth and development, including through its work on South-South and triangular cooperation and regional integration, while being particularly mindful of the needs and priorities of developing countries.",

The scale of the impact is especially acute in small island developing States, making them more vulnerable to economic and financial shocks than other developing countries, which is further compounded by limited financial, technological and policy design capacities. The path to a more sustainable and equitable recovery requires addressing underlying structural fragilities, including the development finance gap, which is also in line with the UNCTAD strategy to support small island developing States. The subprogramme has been working to strengthen the national capacities of selected small island developing States in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean to mobilize affordable external financial resources for climate resilience and sustainable development, thereby simultaneously achieving climate-related priorities and external financial sustainability. The work in this area includes the development of a sustainable development finance assessment framework for target countries, considering the funding gaps related to the climate-related Goals, and supporting these countries in implementing a national external financial strategy and enhancing their development finance management capacity.",

To improve sustainability practices in investment, the subprogramme has been providing policy guidance and tools to member States.

The subprogramme has been supporting Portuguese-speaking countries in fostering a culture of competition law and policy and establishing a framework for ongoing regional cooperation. The subprogramme contributed to increased knowledge of emerging competition issues among competition and sectoral regulatory experts by conducting four training events with government officials from six countries, including representatives of Brazil and Portugal. Further, the subprogramme has supported the drafting of the competition law of Timor-Leste as part of its WTO accession (2024), the development of the new Mozambique leniency programme to facilitate the enforcement of laws against anti-competitive practices, and ongoing assessments of the competition and consumer protection laws of Guinea-Bissau. Furthermore, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste have integrated competition policy into their development strategies.",

Developing countries hold most of the world’s critical mineral reserves, with African countries accounting for about 25 per cent of global reserves. This is an opportunity to create jobs, diversify economies and boost revenues. To allow these countries to move beyond raw material supply, the subprogramme has been supporting them in identifying issues related to trade in critical minerals, climate action and sustainable development, and in exploring pathways for economic diversification in commodity-dependent developing countries. Furthermore, in 2024 the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals outlined key principles and actionable recommendations that will be used by the subprogramme to assist countries.",

While the Sustainable Development Goals have defined measurable targets for member States to assess their transition to a climate-resilient and sustainable economy, many developing countries are facing a tougher burden from the crisis of climate change and are lagging behind in the transition due to a lack of financial and technological resources. To ensure that trade is part of the solution, the subprogramme has been working closely with developing countries through its Automated System for Customs Data, which helps countries to increase public revenues, reduce costs and ease trade while eliminating the use of paper, promoting sustainable transport and improving supply chain efficiency, as supported by data on the ground showing a reduction in paper use by up to 90 per cent and reduced emissions in the clearance processes.",

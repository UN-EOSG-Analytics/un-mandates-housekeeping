The development gains achieved to date continue to be jeopardized by conflict, which, in some cases, has set back decades-long progress; political instability and social unrest; governance, social and economic challenges; and the impact of a changing climate on ecosystems. The Pact for the Future offers the region another chance to harness artificial intelligence, digital innovation and predictive analytics, in line with the Global Digital Compact, to address the complex and interrelated challenges that it faces, including economic volatility, social inequalities, conflict and the impacts of climate change, and to take decisive action towards achieving the aspirations of the people of the Arab region for a prosperous future for all. Given its regional mandate, ESCWA is uniquely positioned to support national development trajectories and priorities by leveraging its expertise, toolkits and partnerships, in support of jointly owned development solutions and outcomes. The support delivered by the Commission to member States is also provided through the regular programme of technical cooperation and Development Account projects.",

During 2024, best practices for mainstreaming water, energy and food security into nationally determined contributions were shared during five regional forums convened or co-convened by ESCWA. The aim was to empower member States to broaden sector and stakeholder engagement in nationally determined contribution preparation and to articulate evidence-based adaptation programmes alongside mitigation goals. By the end of 2024, three member States (Iraq, Lebanon and Tunisia) benefited from improved capacity and tailored knowledge products to prepare their next round of nationally determined contributions.",

Considering pressures on public budgets and financing gaps, mobilizing funding without adding more debt is a priority. The ESCWA climate/the Sustainable Development Goals debt swap initiative supports member States in developing programme-based debt swaps towards enhancing fiscal space to finance climate action and the Goals. Building on the previous achievements of the initiative, the subprogramme supported Tunisia in operationalizing an inter-agency task force mandated with the development of a climate/Goals debt swap programme, including a priority list of projects, for negotiation with creditors. The projects were to contribute to achieving nationally determined contribution priority action in areas such as water, energy and the environment, while addressing climate and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Specifically, in 2024 the subprogramme promoted an inclusive, intersectoral platform approach and provided technical expertise and advice, including on the establishment of key performance indicators for impact assessments at the project and programme levels, which also facilitated the prioritization of projects.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will collaborate with member States to enhance their capacity in internationally agreed frameworks for the compilation of and reporting on international trade statistics, alternative methodologies and programming skills. In addition, the peer-to-peer exchange of knowledge will be facilitated through study tours, to further empower the targeted countries to produce trade statistics independently.",

The initiative was set up as a network of Arab city leaders and global development stakeholders to empower local governance and catalyse resilience and sustainability in cities throughout the region. In 2024, the first iteration of the Academy gathered experts from more than 20 global entities, including international organizations, non-governmental organizations, academia and the private sector, to offer 11 senior city officials a hybrid curriculum, primarily in Arabic, focusing on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals, emergency preparedness, smart sustainable cities, quality of life in cities, climate resilience, urban financing, partnerships and diplomacy, among others. Moreover, the online discussions component was open to the broader public, reaching more than 80 representatives of local authorities on each occasion.",

Specifically, in order to foster transparency and stakeholder engagement, the subprogramme developed a dynamic platform that allowed Oman’s 55 implementing entities to update data by priority, strategic goal, activity and key performance indicator, enhancing accountability and proactive problem-solving. This was followed by a facilitated consultative process, during which the assessment results served as a basis for the identification of challenges and opportunities for accelerating the plan’s implementation. The support culminated in Oman identifying ways to enhance implementation and guide planning as it embarked on defining its next five-year development plan.",

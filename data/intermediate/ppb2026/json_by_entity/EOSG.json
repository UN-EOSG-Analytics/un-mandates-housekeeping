Therefore, such preparations are, in many cases, finalized close to the departure date and are subject to last-minute changes. Furthermore, the official visits, in most cases, involve multiple consecutive meetings in different countries and regions in order to save financial resources that would have been otherwise incurred had the travel been to a single destination with a round trip to New York. Hence, the coordination of these multiple-leg trips with numerous high-level participants is more complex and involves additional extensive preparations with unforeseen circumstances. It should be noted that the Executive Office often works directly with the Travel Unit and reserves the tickets on the basis of a preliminary itinerary to secure the tickets at a low price, before the formal actions are recorded in Umoja, which are then completed at a later stage, once final information is confirmed. The Executive Office is mindful of and takes the utmost efforts to achieve improved compliance with the advance booking of air travel policy.",

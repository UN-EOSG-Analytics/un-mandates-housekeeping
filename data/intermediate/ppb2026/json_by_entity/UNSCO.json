The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including Assembly resolutions 48/213 and 49/88, as well as Security Council resolutions 1860 (2009) and 2334 (2016). The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains at the core of the instability prevailing in the Middle East and continues to threaten international peace and security. As violence and tensions persist across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, the Office continues to engage to mitigate and prevent armed conflict, address humanitarian and development challenges, including recovery and reconstruction efforts in Gaza, and engage the parties and the international community with a view to making political progress towards a two-State solution.",

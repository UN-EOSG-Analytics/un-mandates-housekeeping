BINUH developed a political strategy addressing six areas of support: (a) facilitating an inclusive national dialogue; (b) supporting electoral and constitutional reforms; (c) enhancing public security; (d) strengthening the rule of law; (e) improving governance and institutional capacity; and (f) fostering United Nations system integration and regional partnerships. Implementation of the strategy and support on strategic communications is reported to the Security Council through the reports of the Secretary-General on a quarterly basis. In a series of public statements issued in January 2025, the transitional authorities reaffirmed their commitment to finalize the ongoing constitutional reform process and hold credible elections before the end of 2025.",

These repeated changes in Haitian leadership coincided with a marked escalation in gang violence, which in November 2024 led to the closing of the international airport, the suspension of all commercial flights and a flight ban imposed by the United States Federal Aviation Administration over Haitian airspace. The United Nations Department of Safety and Security subsequently authorised the evacuation of Programme Criticality 2 (PC 2) personnel from the capital and the relocation of PC 1 and PC 2 personnel to the regions outside Port-au-Prince. The Designated Official, in consultation with the Security Management Team, decided to retain a ceiling of 133 UN personnel in the capital based on the assessed extraction capacity by air and road. Under this ceiling, BINUH maintains a skeleton team of 17 personnel headed by the Special Representative. Skeleton Team personnel are replaced by a pool of 51 international staff rotating on the rest and recuperation cycle every four weeks while the remaining international staff work remotely. Following this second evacuation in November 2024, the Secretary-General launched a strategic assessment and advised the Security Council on the full range of options for continued United Nations efforts in Haiti, which include increasing the robustness of BINUH to stay and deliver and establishing a UN logistic support office for the multinational security support Mission that would operate separately from BINUH.",

This situation triggered a review by the Secretariat of BINUH’s Mission Concept in April 2025 to update the planning assumptions and risks, notably the security considerations. The updated Mission Concept will prioritise BINUH’s mandated tasks and resources to be cost-effective in the prevailing operating environment. It will include recommendations to rationalize the mission’s structure, size and activities to ensure safe and effective mandate implementation. The Mission Concept review is expected to be largely completed in June 2025, prior to the Security Council’s consultations on the mission’s mandate extension in mid-July 2025. The Mission Concept will be finalized within three weeks after the issuance of the new mandate. The implications of the Mission Concept review and the new mandate, as approved by the Security Council, will be assessed and presented in the context of revised estimates.",

The number of intentional homicides surged from 4,847 in 2023 to over 7,000 in 2024. BINUH continued to mentor and advise senior national police commanders on effectively addressing criminal networks and gangs, especially on anti-gang operations and intelligence gathering. The mission supported the Haitian National Police in developing a roadmap for the elaboration of a multi-year strategic development plan aimed at strengthening institutional and operational capacities, promoting the rule of law, and enhancing security. The international community has also been actively engaged in efforts to professionalize the Haitian National Police. Advocacy supported by BINUH, for a UNDP-managed multi-donor basket fund has disbursed $14.1 million as of 31 December 2024, including commitments and advances, out of the initial allocated budget of $25.5 million, corresponding to an implementation rate of 54.4 per cent. In addition, a two-year extension (2024-2026) has been granted to the basket fund to allow for the achievement of expected outcomes and the full disbursement of remaining funds. However, the implementation of the planned activities in 2024 has faced delays, primarily due to operational constraints resulting from the worsening security situation and the closure of the international airport.",

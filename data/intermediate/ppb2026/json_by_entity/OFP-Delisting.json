The mandate was extended in subsequent resolutions 2083 (2012), 2161 (2014) and 2255 (2015) and, most recently, strengthened in resolution 2744 (2024). The Focal Point is mandated to review delisting requests from individuals, groups, undertakings or entities designated on the lists of the sanctions committees established by the Security Council, excluding the sanctions list of the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee which falls under the purview of the Office of the Ombudsperson established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1904 (2009). The Focal Point is also mandated to deal with requests for travel ban and asset freeze exemptions, and communications related to cases of false or mistaken identity and post-delisting challenges, from certain listed individuals or entities.",

In 2024, the Secretariat undertook the recruitment of the Focal Point and presented candidates to the Informal Working Group for its consideration and approval. The Secretariat also conducted outreach activities to Member States, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations providing briefings on the new delisting procedures and recruitment process of the Focal Point. It also informed current petitioners about procedural changes and their right to elect to withdraw their petitions without prejudice and resubmit them for consideration under the revised delisting procedure.",

This report assists the relevant committee in its decision-making process, thereby contributing to the strengthening of due process. The Focal Point also submits two biannual reports on the mission’s activities to the Informal Working Group of the Security Council on General United Nations Security Council Sanctions Issues and participates in various international and regional forums to raise awareness about the new delisting procedure.",

In 1965, in its resolution 2037 (XX), the General Assembly acknowledged the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples. In 1995, the Assembly adopted the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond in its resolution 50/81, which provided a policy framework and practical guidelines to improve the situation of young people. In 2007, the Assembly adopted the Supplement to the Word Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond in its resolution 62/126, which provided further guidance on promoting the participation of young people in social and economic development. Since 2015, the Security Council, in its resolutions 2250 (2015), 2419 (2018) and 2535 (2020), has called upon all relevant actors to increase the inclusive representation of young people in the prevention and resolution of conflict, including when negotiating and implementing peace agreements.",

On 27 October 2023, the Secretary-General appointed the first-ever Assistant Secretary-General for Youth Affairs to lead the Office, representing the youngest serving Assistant Secretary-General in the history of the Organization. The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and the Security Council, including Assembly resolutions 50/81, 62/126, 76/306, 77/336 and 78/179 and Council resolutions 2250 (2015), 2419 (2018) and 2535 (2020).",

Anchored in Chapter IV of the Pact for the Future, and the Declaration on Future Generations, the event amplified youth voices, fostered intergenerational dialogue, and strengthened accountability for commitments. It culminated in a Youth Action Day Outcome Document outlining over 20 recommendations across three principles: inclusion, equity, and trust; and six key themes: gender equality, technology and digital infrastructure, intergenerational solidarity and equity; climate and environmental sustainability, governance and humanitarian action. These efforts positioned young people as co-creators in shaping global policy and the future.",

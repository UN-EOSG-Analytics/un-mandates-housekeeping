The mission focused on establishing a road map to operationalize and implement commitments agreed upon in December 2023, which included a set of measures to improve the lives of Yemenis, while dialogue and planning continued on de-escalation and a nation-wide ceasefire. Meetings were held with political, economic, and military representatives, as well as media, civil society, women and youth, across multiple governorates in Yemen and in the region to gather their feedback on political, economic and security issues. These activities occurred amidst growing regional and economic tensions, affecting essential financial services. On 23 July 2024, the mission announced that the parties agreed to measures to de-escalate tensions in the banking and air transport sectors. Additional complexities arose from the Houthis’ arbitrary detention of various UN, diplomatic and civil society personnel, leading to a severe restriction on civic space.

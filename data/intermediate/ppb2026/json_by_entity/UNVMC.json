The increased requirements are offset in part by: (a) reduced requirements for international staff owing to lower estimated common staff costs (estimated common staff costs as a percentage of salary costs of 51.7 per cent compared to 56.8 per cent in the 2025 budget); (b) reduced requirements for national staff owing to the application of higher vacancy rates for National Professional Officers and Local level staff; (c) reduced requirements for consultants owing to the higher reliance on in-house expertise; (d) reduced requirements under facilities and infrastructure owing to lower estimated costs for the rental of premises and non-acquisition of furniture; (e) lower estimated costs for rental of vehicles owing to efficiencies gained through the full transfer of rental of vehicles to the United Nations fleet modality; (f) fewer acquisition of communication and information technology equipment; (g) lower requirements for medical services; (h) lower requirements for freight due to fewer acquisition; and (i) lower requirements under other services, owing to a planned reduction in meeting facilitation, as a cost avoidance measure.",

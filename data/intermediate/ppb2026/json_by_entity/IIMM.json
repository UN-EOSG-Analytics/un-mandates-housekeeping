To date, the Mechanism has shared with competent authorities over 1 million information items in diverse formats, including witness statements, documents, photographs, videos, audio files, geospatial imagery, open-source materials and in-depth analytical products, on various matters of high contextual and evidentiary value to the ongoing proceedings. In September and November 2024 respectively, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office No. 9 of Argentina and the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court made submissions to their respective judicial authorities seeking arrest warrants for certain individuals who are alleged to be responsible for serious international crimes committed against the Rohingya. The written submissions phase of the proceedings at the International Court of Justice regarding alleged violations by Myanmar of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide concluded in late 2024 and oral hearings on the merits are expected to begin in 2025.",

In doing so, the Mechanism will continue to engage with individuals from a wide range of locations and backgrounds in an effort to increase the pool of witnesses in stable security situations who may be available to testify in judicial proceedings.

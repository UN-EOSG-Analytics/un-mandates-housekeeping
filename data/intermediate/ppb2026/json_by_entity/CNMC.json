The decrease in requirements is offset in part by: (a) increased requirements for international staff due to the application of the revised salary rates and higher estimated common staff costs  (common staff costs as a percentage of salary costs of 56.9 per cent compared to 50.4 per cent in the 2025 budget) based on past expenditure; (b) increased requirements for national posts due to the application of a lower vacancy rate of zero per cent compared to the rate of 12.5 per cent approved for 2025; (c) increased requirements for facilities and infrastructure owing to higher estimated costs for the rental of premises and utilities for the office collocated with UNOWAS in Abuja, Nigeria.",

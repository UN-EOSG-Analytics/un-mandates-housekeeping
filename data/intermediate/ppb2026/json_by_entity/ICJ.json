It is composed of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council and is one of six principal organs of the United Nations and the principal judicial organ of the Organization. It functions in accordance with the Statute of the Court, which is an integral part of the Charter. All 193 States Members of the United Nations are Parties to the Statute, and 74 of them have recognized the Court’s jurisdiction as compulsory, in line with Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. In addition, more than 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties grant the Court compulsory jurisdiction in the resolution of various types of disputes. States that are not members of the United Nations may become Parties to the Statute on conditions to be determined in each case by the Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The Court may also be open to States not Parties to its Statute, subject to the conditions laid down by the Security Council and set out in its resolution 9 (1946), adopted on 15 October 1946. The Court submits annual reports to the Assembly, the most recent of which is contained in document A/79/4. Under the terms of regulation 2.14 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, the programme budget proposals of the Court are prepared by the Court, in consultation with the Secretary-General, and are submitted to the Assembly by the Secretary-General, together with such observations as the latter may deem desirable.",

New cases are brought before the Court by States, and advisory opinions are requested of the Court by authorized organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, all of whom may seize the Court at any time. When a case is pending before the Court, it is not possible to anticipate whether and when recourse will be made to incidental proceedings (e.g. requests for provisional measures or interventions). Historically, there have been significant variations in the number of new proceedings commenced in a given year, although in recent times there has been an upward trend in the Court’s caseload. In order to meet the demands of its workload, the Court now routinely considers three cases simultaneously. In 2024, the Court was seized of four new cases, including one request for an advisory opinion, the fourth such request since 2023. In 2024, the Court also delivered four judgments, one advisory opinion and five orders on requests for the indication or modification of provisional measures. During the same period, the Court held nine sets of hearings, including two in advisory proceedings, one of which involved the participation of 96 States and 11 international organizations. With 26 cases pending on its General List as at 30 April 2025 – which involve, inter alia, 133 States Members of the United Nations – the Court will no doubt maintain its increased judicial workload in the years to come.",

In principle, the parties to cases brought before the Court each submit one set of written pleadings to the Court: a memorial and a counter-memorial. The Court may authorize them to submit a further set of pleadings, namely, a reply and a rejoinder. In practice, these additional pleadings are almost always submitted. The pleadings are tending to become increasingly voluminous, notwithstanding the Court’s appeals to the parties not to repeat arguments already exposed. Hearings can also be long and complex, depending on the nature of the case. In cases involving difficult factual issues (e.g. of a highly technical character), parties may call witnesses and experts to testify. In addition, in recent years, a number of States have intervened in contentious proceedings, including at hearings. Once it has heard the submissions of the parties, the Court delivers a decision within as short a time as possible, allowing for the complexity of the case. The entire proceedings must be conducted simultaneously in both of the Court’s official languages, English and French, both at the written and oral stages and during deliberations.",

Additionally, capacity-building initiatives in 2026 will address barriers to women’s professional development in the rule of law sector and promote gender sensitivity among decision-makers. Further efforts will focus on federated policing, justice, and corrections models, promoting judicial independence, civilian oversight, and accountability to enhance access to justice, particularly in fragile areas. Coordination with AUSSOM and national capacity development will also be strengthened. These tasks will progressively be handed over to the appropriate national authorities and to the United Nations country team and international partners by 31 October 2026, according to a transition roadmap to be agreed with the Federal Government of Somalia.",

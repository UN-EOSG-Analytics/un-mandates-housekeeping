The mandate of the Office derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and/or decisions, including resolutions 60/1 and 60/248. The Office also assists the Secretary-General in reporting annually to the Assembly on the implementation of ethics policies in response to Assembly resolution 60/254 and on the activities of the Ethics Panel of the United Nations pursuant to Assembly resolution 63/250. Pursuant to Assembly resolution 77/278, the Office directly presents an annual report to the Assembly. Further to Assembly resolution 70/305, the Office has been mandated to participate in providing an induction briefing to all Presidents of the General Assembly and their offices, to review the financial disclosures of those Presidents and to vet all private contributions to the Office of the President of the General Assembly. As provided for in Assembly resolution 71/263, the Office aims to do its part in the swift and effective implementation of the revised policy on protection against retaliation and to cultivate an organizational culture in which staff feel free to speak up.",

In parallel, the Office made additional efforts to raise awareness of the relevance of ethics standards to day-to-day work of the staff, including through the annual Leadership Dialogue and the periodic distribution of iSeek articles. Publication of these articles led to increased interest among staff members in ethics guidance and a sharp increase in the number of visitors to the Office’s intranet site. In 2024, in response to the increased queries related to the financial disclosure programme, the Office created a dedicated site on the Knowledge Gateway portal, where staff members can access information and guidance on the programme’s scope and objectives. Through these resources, the Office will continue efforts to improve access to ethics-related guidance for staff members across the world.",

Lack of awareness and understanding can give rise to risks of failure to detect conflict of interest, misinterpretation of regulations and rules, and resulting conflicts of interest are significantly higher. In applying this lesson, the Office will enhance its engagement with management and staff participating in the financial disclosure programme to ensure that staff fully comply with the programme’s requirements, and through proactive advice to mitigate and prevent actual and potential conflicts of interest captured through the programme.",

Its mandate derives from relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including resolutions 319 A (IV), by which the Assembly established the Office, and 428 (V), which sets out its statute. In addition, the international legal basis for the protection of refugees finds its principal expression in the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 1967. UNHCR also has responsibilities for stateless persons pursuant to paragraph 6 (A) (ii) of its statute and article I (A) (2) of the 1951 Convention with regard to refugees who are stateless, as well as to various Assembly resolutions, including resolutions 3274 (XXIX) and 31/36 in relation to the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of 1954 and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961. Over the years, the mandate of UNHCR has been extended to other groups through various Assembly resolutions. UNHCR provides protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, working in cooperation with the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and in the context of the collaborative response of the United Nations system, as well as with the consent of the State concerned.",

In 2024, UNHCR transitioned nine of its offices to solar energy in Mauritania, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda, which resulted in an average cost saving of 31 per cent against previous energy costs and a carbon emissions reduction of 53 per cent once the installation was completed. A further 18 offices are planned for transition in 2025. For vehicle management, the Smart Fleet ridesharing programme is currently implemented at 188 UNHCR offices, saving over $1.1 million and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 560 tons during 2024. Continued scale-up is planned during 2025, with a target of 250 offices by the end of the year. In addition to ridesharing and carpooling, UNHCR is transitioning to 30 per cent more fuel-efficient vehicles across the fleet. The UNHCR global fleet includes 27 electric vehicles in use in Aruba, Hungary, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nepal and Switzerland, and 90 hybrid vehicles in 28 countries as at the end of 2024.",

The Assembly, in section VII of its resolution 63/263, endorsed the maintenance of the lump-sum arrangement for the funding of UNHCR in future budget presentations of the proposed programme budget, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/63/616, para. 10).",

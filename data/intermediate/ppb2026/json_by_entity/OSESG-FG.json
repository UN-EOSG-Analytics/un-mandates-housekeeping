It also comprises a decision to “convene an inclusive high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on future generations that will review the implementation of this Declaration during the eighty-third session of the General Assembly and provide updates on the actions taken to safeguard the needs and interests of future generations” and a request to the Secretary-General to “present a report on the implementation of this Declaration for consideration at the high-level plenary meeting to be held during the eighty-third session of the General Assembly” (para. 32).",

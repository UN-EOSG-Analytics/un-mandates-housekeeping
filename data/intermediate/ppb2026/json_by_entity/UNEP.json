The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including resolution 2997 (XXVII), and by the Governing Council of UNEP in its decision 19/1. That decision set out the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of the United Nations Environment Programme, which the Assembly subsequently endorsed in 1997 in the annex to its resolution S-19/2 and further reaffirmed in its resolutions 53/242, in 1999, and 66/288 and 67/213, in 2012. In Assembly resolution 70/1, Member States recognized the importance of the environmental dimension to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Within its mandate, UNEP will support Member States by providing strategic direction towards the achievement of environmental sustainability, while contributing to a balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Acknowledging the integrated nature of the challenges that countries face, UNEP will play a critical role in catalysing the fulfilment of the commitments and actions that drive transformational change for sustainable development.",

In 2024, the subprogramme, through the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, published the Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction: Beyond Foundations, which outlined that, in 2022, the buildings sector was responsible for 34 per cent of global energy demand and 37 per cent of energy and process-related carbon dioxide emissions. To maintain the momentum for the Buildings Breakthrough initiative, in 2024 the subprogramme co-organized, with the Government of France, the first Buildings and Climate Global Forum, which gathered national ministers and high-level representatives from across the buildings sector value chain to discuss pathways for mainstreaming sustainable solutions to reduce the sector’s emissions. The Forum concluded with 70 countries adopting the Chaillot Declaration, which set a foundation international cooperation on the issue.",

The International Methane Emissions Observatory provides transparent, reliable and actionable data to reduce and mitigate methane emissions. In 2024, the subprogramme enhanced the platform to assemble a public database of empirically verified methane emissions data, sourced from satellites and global scientific measurement campaigns. That comprehensive approach enabled countries and companies to take swift, targeted action to reduce emissions. In 2024, the Observatory’s system notified companies and Governments of approximately 1,900 releases. The alerts spanned five continents and helped emitters to plug major leaks. Overall, data from the observatory have prevented the release of greenhouse gases equivalent to the amount produced by more than 1 million cars over the course of a year.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will build on its successes by enhancing the capacities of legal stakeholders, such as judges, prosecutors, legal practitioners, parliamentarians and enforcement officials, through regular training programmes, capacity-building events and dialogues on issues of environmental law. This work will also be complemented by the development of toolkits, legislative assessment reports and targeted guidance materials.",

The subprogramme delivers interventions at the subnational, national, regional and global levels by supporting the development and implementation of policies, strategies and mechanisms and promoting cooperation, capacity-building and knowledge generation and knowledge-sharing. At the subnational level, the subprogramme provided policy recommendations and facilitated multi-stakeholder collaboration on wastewater and sanitation in Sabah, Malaysia. In Iraq, in partnership with the International Office on Migration, the subprogramme established a pilot wetland system in Islah, Dhi Qar Governorate, to recycle wastewater, which is expected to benefit 30,000 people by 2025. In Comoros, the subprogramme supported integrating extended producer responsibility principles into national waste legislation. In the Gambia, the subprogramme funded and guided the development of a national solid waste management strategy based on circular economy principles. Regionally, the UNEP zero waster in the Caribbean initiative supported the eighth high-level forum on waste management, held in Port of Spain in October 2024, at which ministers adopted a declaration on regional action towards zero waste. Circular economy approaches, improved waste management policies, financial mobilization, digital transformation and enhanced data systems to support sustainable waste management are emphasized in the declaration. Globally, UNEP convened the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and co-launched the declaration on reducing methane from organic waste at the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in November 2024. More than 30 countries, responsible for nearly 50 per cent of global methane emissions from organic waste, endorsed the declaration and committed themselves to integrating targets for reducing methane emissions into future nationally determined contributions.",

In 2024, the subprogramme worked to foster sustainability through targeted capacity-building, multi-stakeholder partnerships and integrating circular economy approaches into national and regional frameworks. For example, the subprogramme facilitated the adoption of 14 policies to advance sustainable transitions globally, including in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Uruguay. The subprogramme’s work also contributed to the development of the Latin America and the Caribbean regional strategy on sustainable consumption and production (2024–2030) and to the adoption of United Nations Environment Assembly resolutions 6/1, on the circularity of a resilient and low-carbon sugar cane agro-industry, and 6/8, on promoting sustainable lifestyles.",

Fundamental changes in the way in which societies produce and consume goods and services are required, by making the transition to more sustainable economic and business models that promote sustainable consumption and production patterns and sustainable lifestyles. The subprogramme has provided policy advice, developed global knowledge products and facilitated global and regional policy initiatives in high-impact sectors to support countries in providing the enabling conditions for sustainable consumption and production (market signals, policy frameworks, incentives, innovation, infrastructure and education), accelerating the transition to sustainable development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",

It will also implement adaptive monitoring mechanisms to track progress and refine strategies dynamically.

This will be informed by assessments of the causes and effects of environmental challenges, as well as emerging issues of global, regional and national significance. UNEP will work through inter-agency mechanisms such as the United Nations Environment Management Group and the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and its subsidiary bodies, to support and enhance coordination, cooperation and collaboration across the United Nations system through system-wide strategies and common approaches on the environment, such as the common approach on biodiversity and the common approach on pollution. In addition, UNEP will work to integrate the priorities of multilateral environmental agreements into United Nations country programming, ensuring a more coordinated and effective response to specific country needs. The year 2026 will mark the first year of the implementation of the UNEP medium-term strategy and programme of work for the period 2026–2027. UNEP has a new set of targets for 2026 and 2027, focusing on indicators that are aligned with organizational objectives, the Sustainable Development Goals and internationally agreed environmental commitments.

Organizational responsibility for serving the Committee lies with UNEP. The secretariat of the Committee convenes the annual sessions and coordinates the development of such documents, which are compiled using scientific and technical information obtained from Member States and scientific literature in accordance with the Committee’s requests. Once approved by the Committee, these documents are published periodically as scientific annexes to the report of the Committee to the General Assembly, after a formulation period that lasts, in general, four to five years, in a rolling publication scheme. The secretariat arranges for the dissemination of the Committee’s findings to the Assembly, the scientific community and the public.",

In line with the letters of 2018, the mission also continues to carry out the functions previously performed by the Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan relating to the maintenance of good and peaceful neighbourly relations between the Sudan and South Sudan, established pursuant to the exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council in 2011 (S/2011/474 and S/2011/475). The mandate includes cooperation with the African Union High-level Implementation Panel in efforts to implement Security Council resolution 2046 (2012), in which the Council called upon the Sudan and South Sudan to reach an agreement on critical issues, including: (a) the full and urgent advancement of all outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; and (b) the easing of tensions and the facilitation of the resumption of negotiations on post-secession relations and the normalization of their relations. Furthermore, the mission works closely with and supports member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in line with the Joint Framework for Cooperation between the United Nations and IGAD signed in Djibouti on 17 November 2015, and other regional organizations in promoting peace and security across the Horn of Africa.",

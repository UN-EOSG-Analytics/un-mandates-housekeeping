The six grave violations are the denial of humanitarian access for children (resolution 1261 (1999)); the recruitment and use of children (resolution 1379 (2001)); the killing and maiming of children (resolution 1882 (2009)); rape and other forms of sexual violence against children (ibid.); attacks on schools and hospitals (resolution 1998 (2011)); and the abduction of children (resolution 2225 (2015)). The Office of the Special Representative works primarily in the situations of armed conflict or of concern identified in the annual report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict. The Office covers 25 situations in 5 geographical regions and promotes enhanced monitoring and reporting at the subregional level in the Lake Chad basin and central Sahel regions, in accordance with the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in 2024 (A/78/842-S/2024/384).",

The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) specifically aims to protect children, every person below the age of 18, from being recruited or used in hostilities. Children recruited or used by parties to conflict suffer dramatic forms of exploitation and abuse and once released, their recovery requires sustained, tailored, and child-centered reintegration programmes.  The Office consistently advocates with parties to conflict, both armed forces and armed groups, to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children. After a continuous increase in verified incidents since 2021 due to the emergence of new conflicts and the intensification of existing conflict situations, the recruitment and use of children decreased by 14 per cent in 2024. This reflects the critical role the Office played through its sustained engagement with its partners, with Member States and parties to conflict to adopt measures to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children. Such measures included handover protocols or action plans, and advocacy at international, regional and national levels to secure commitments such as the ratification and implementation of international instruments like OPAC or the endorsement of political commitments such as the Paris Principles.",

In disaster-related financing strategies, disproportionate emphasis is often placed on post-disaster financing needs and instruments, while the financing of preventive measures is sometimes overlooked. In applying the lesson, the programme will support activities aimed at ensuring the integration of disaster risk reduction into future financing strategies by assisting countries in identifying policy reforms, institutional arrangements and approaches that serve to unlock financing for risk reduction and complement post-disaster financing instruments.",

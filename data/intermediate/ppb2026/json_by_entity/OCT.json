In 2023 and 2024, the Office, in coordination with IOM and UNODC, supported the establishment of the Integrated Border Stability Mechanism in Dakar. During 2024, the Mechanism conducted technical consultations in its seven focus countries – Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Togo – engaging national stakeholders to assess border security and governance gaps, needs and priorities. The Office also held technical trainings and workshops at the global and regional levels throughout 2024. This helped to shape the development of the Global Counterterrorism Forum training-of-trainers curriculum, set to be rolled out through regional and national trainings in 2025. The Office also co-led the production of a good practices addendum on border security and management, complemented by a practical train-the-trainer manual, with a view to equipping border officials with the knowledge and skills to operationalize these good practices globally.",

In 2020, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions, including 2462 (2019) and 2482 (2019), and responding to Member States’ requests, the Office launched a multi-year global programme to support intra- and inter-agency coordination mechanisms on intelligence, analysis and investigations. In 2023, the programme developed a compendium of good practices and related guidelines on establishing and operating a national inter-agency coordination mechanism, including seven study guides, and a 13-week modular training portfolio offering 12 courses to Member State analysts. Since 2020, the programme has trained over 1,400 participants from 32 African intelligence and law enforcement agencies. On the basis of post-training assessments, 100 per cent of trainees’ managers indicated that their trained staff were performing better as a direct result of the programme.",

The Mechanism has developed dedicated thematic strategies related to these factors, with the recognition that, without proactive strategies, the experiences of specific groups of victims and survivors are insufficiently addressed in accountability processes. These thematic strategies have been developed and implemented since the commencement of the Mechanism’s work and continue to be further refined as part of the Mechanism’s victim- and survivor-centred approach, as reported to the General Assembly.",

In line with the efforts to continue to improve the gender balance in the Mission’s staffing, and taking into account the prospects of shrinking extrabudgetary resources, it is proposed that the existing nine female national United Nations Volunteer positions currently funded from extrabudgetary resources be converted to regular budget funding in 2026, to continue to support programmes of work of components across the Mission. The conversion provides some element of assured continuity in this flagship initiative which supports the advancement of women’s involvement in society and support UNAMA’s gender parity efforts to employ and empower young professional Afghan women who would otherwise be struggling to find professional purpose in their lives after graduation.",

Currently, the Mission operates physical security operations centre in each field location, with 46 Field Security Radio Operators providing security communications support nationwide, Under the remote modality, security communication operations will be consolidated in Kabul. which will centrally monitor and operate remote field radio networks. With the implementation of the remote centre, the number of physical security operation centres in the regions would be reduced, leading to the abolishment of 21 Field Security Radio Operator (Local level) posts across the various field offices. To this end, it is further proposed that the centre be constituted through the continuation of 4 existing posts in Kabul and the redeployment of 17 Field Security Radio Operator (Local level) post from the field offices (10 from the regional offices and 7 from the provisional offices. The following changes in the Section are therefore proposed for 2026:",

In this regard, the Secretariat intends to transition the peace operations currently supported by the KJSO, to the RSCE by the end of the UNAMI liquidation process which is anticipated to end in September 2026, leading to the abolishment of the existing 38 UNAMA funded posts, effective 1 October 2026.

The seat price which UNHAS offers on its regular flights allows the Mission to use UNHAS services as required and to plan for the reduced number of non-guaranteed flight hours and corresponding reduced amount of aviation fuel. The Mission actively seeks opportunities for cost-sharing with UNHAS, for example, from collocated use of UN Air Terminals. The Mission has an MOU on Cooperation in Air Operations with UNHAS and supports UNHAS requests for air transportation on a cost reimbursement basis. Further opportunities for cooperation are explored and will be considered in the 2027 aviation budget proposal. \nIt is however important to consider that UNAMA has only one aircraft to assure duty of care and routine transportation needs of mission personnel deployed in 11 locations around Afghanistan.  At the same time UNHAS, faced with substantially reduced donor funding, recently reduced its fleet of aircraft from 7 to 3, including the loss of the last remaining helicopter which could operate to locations that cannot be served by fixed-wing aircraft, including response to critical medical emergencies which could occur in remote locations. In view of the downsizing of UNHAS air fleet, higher utilization of the Mission’s aircraft is anticipated in 2026, which has been factored into the budgeted flight hours.\n",

In 2024, the subprogramme continued to use its Verified initiative – originally launched during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic – to build information literacy on issues related to climate change. The Verified communications model employed a three-pillar approach to reach audiences: trusted messengers engaged audiences at the grass-roots level; global creative campaigns reached target audiences en masse; and convenings encouraged people to focus on expert insights and solutions for global cooperation. For the first pillar, the subprogramme enlisted climate experts, scientists and Indigenous leaders in Brazil, Spain and the United Arab Emirates as trusted messengers. Combined, these 43 messengers created over 220 videos to combat misinformation, disinformation and information manipulation on social media, reaching 600 million people. For the second pillar, a campaign entitled “The Future Thanks You”, launched in April 2024, appealed for a transition to renewable sources of energy. Through a dedicated microsite, over 30,000 people around the world submitted responses to questions about the future they envisioned. For the third pillar, a round table on the theme “Winning the climate story” brought together scientists, media practitioners and campaigners to discuss communications for driving climate action. Through this multifaceted approach, the subprogramme enabled engagement of the global public on factual and evidence-based information related to climate change.",

Whenever viewers anywhere in the world see news about the Security Council or the General Assembly with multi-camera coverage, the footage comes from United Nations Television and Video. During the high-level segment of the seventy-ninth session of the General Assembly, United Nations Television and Video directed and transmitted coverage and managed access for broadcasters at the Sustainable Development Goals media zone. It also introduced, for the first time, live camera media points for broadcasters and Member States in two different locations at United Nations Headquarters. By providing access to live broadcast points, the subprogramme offered broadcasters the chance to set up live two-way interviews from United Nations Headquarters in real time, providing audiences of participating broadcasters with a unique bespoke live interview experience capturing the essence of proceedings as events unfolded. These live points enabled Heads of State and Government to address national broadcasters and allowed dignitaries and senior officials to engage with the press and broadcasters globally in live interviews. As the week progressed, broadcasters were eager to make use of the live point service offered by the subprogramme: bookings for the service increased, and positive feedback was received from all broadcasters who used the service. This growing demand allowed the subprogramme to extend its reach to global audiences that it would not otherwise have been able to engage.",

The Conference was an inclusive platform for dialogue that enabled meaningful engagement for civil society and other stakeholders with United Nations leadership, Governments, the co-facilitators of the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations. With the participation of more than 1,400 organizations and 2,600 individuals representing 115 nationalities, the Conference showcased civil society’s contributions towards multilateral processes. Moreover, the subprogramme’s outreach with civil society contributed to the formation of 20 ImPACT Coalitions.

The Department of Global Communications currently has four outreach programmes: the Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme, which is covered by three staff (1 P-4, 1 P-2 and 1 GS (OL)); the Outreach Programme on the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Slavery, which is covered by three staff (1 P-4, 1 P-3 (GTA) and 1 GS (OL)); the outreach programme on the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and the United Nations, which is covered by two staff (1 P-4 and 1 GS (OL) (GTA)); and the outreach programme entitled “The Srebrenica Genocide and the United Nations”, established pursuant to Assembly resolution 78/282, which has no dedicated posts. \nThe incumbent would be responsible for working with relevant international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as with concerned former colonies among the States Members of the United Nations, to develop an outreach programme to mobilize educational institutions and civil society to expand their activities in the field of remembering colonialism, its root causes and consequences. The incumbent would also work with the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and would be responsible for developing and managing the outreach programme; providing strategic direction on issues, methods and approaches for mobilizing educational institutions and civil society to expand their activities in the field of colonialism, including by providing overall coordination for the preparation of substantive content related to the outreach programme; and leading the development of the outreach programme, including the associated strategy and planning. The P-4 post would be supported by programme management officers (P-3, P-2) and administrative assistants (GS (OL)) from the other outreach programmes, as required.",

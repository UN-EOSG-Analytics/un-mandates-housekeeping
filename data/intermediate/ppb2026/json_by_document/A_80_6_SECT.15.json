UN-Habitat leads and coordinates the monitoring of and reporting on global progress in the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 11. The mandate derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including resolution 3327 (XXIX), by which the Assembly established the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, and resolution 32/162, by which the Assembly established the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat). The Assembly, through its resolution 56/206, transformed the Centre into the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), effective 1 January 2002. The Assembly, through its resolution 73/239, established a new governance structure for the Programme, consisting of the universal UN-Habitat Assembly, the 36-member Executive Board and the Committee of Permanent Representatives. The UN-Habitat Assembly adopted resolutions providing further guidance on the work of UN-Habitat at its first and second sessions, held in May 2019 and June 2023, respectively.",

Approximately 90 per cent of urban growth is taking place in less developed regions, where unplanned growth is driving the rise of informal settlements, slums and homelessness, exacerbating urban poverty, inequality and a lack of adequate and affordable housing. By contrast, many cities in other parts of the world are facing negative growth and shrinking populations. The global housing challenge is intensifying, with the demand for affordable and adequate housing outpacing supply, further deepening inequality and vulnerability, in particular in urban areas. Globally, more than 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing and more than 1.12 billion reside in slums and informal settlements. In addition, there are 304 million international migrants, most of whom live in urban areas, and 75.9 million internally displaced persons.",

In partnership with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the subprogramme implemented projects to enhance water, sanitation and hygiene services and build the climate resilience of local communities. In Sekong, Attapeu and Saravan Provinces, a comprehensive climate risk and vulnerability assessment informed urban planning, resulting in the development of water, sanitation and hygiene resilience plans. Between 2022 and 2024, this initiative benefited some 123,000 people directly, who had access to enhanced water, sanitation and hygiene services. The subprogramme also supported the Government in developing a national climate risk and vulnerability assessment. In addition, capacity-building workshops have benefited more than 200 local stakeholders by enhancing their knowledge on climate-resilient practices and infrastructure management. The projects have not only improved water, sanitation and hygiene services, but also fostered healthier communities that are more resilient to the impacts of climate change.",

However, challenges such as climate change and inequalities in cities are jeopardizing sustainable development. The targets related to the urban resilience of many cities are below the 2015 baselines. While several factors can explain poor progress, a critical factor is often limited coordination across levels of government and policy areas. Given that cities influence economic, social and environmental outcomes beyond their boundaries, it is essential that sustainable urban development policy interventions be designed and implemented across wider territorial scales. In that respect, national urban policies can provide a clear strategic framework and an effective coordination mechanism to articulate policies across the urban-rural continuum, including at metropolitan and regional scales. The subprogramme has, to date, supported 64 countries in developing national urban policies, with a view to enhancing spatial connectivity and productivity and advancing sustainable urban development. In Paraguay, for example, the urban planning, housing and habitat policy was adopted by presidential decree in 2024 and will support the country’s transformative housing programme, through which the Government has already provided more than 17,000 housing units. In addition, the subprogramme, in collaboration with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, published the report Global State of National Urban Policy 2024: Building Resilience and Promoting Adequate, Inclusive and Sustainable Housing, which highlights how national urban policies have become critical instruments in localizing the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 11.",

The subprogramme, in response to UN-Habitat Assembly resolution 2/5, advanced the dissemination of information on innovations relating to climate action, with an emphasis on closing research and knowledge gaps. In 2024, the subprogramme, in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, organized the Innovate4Cities conference, convening nearly 2,000 experts, leaders and advocates across research, government, business and civil society. Directly informed by the 2024 conference, the subprogramme also co-developed an updated “Global research and action agenda on cities and climate change science”, in which 160 knowledge gaps and 259 action priorities were identified that, if addressed, could accelerate climate action implementation at the speed and scale needed to meet Paris Agreement goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. The action agenda is also intended to infuse cutting-edge practice, research and innovation into climate action in cities. The UN-Habitat World Cities Report 2024 drew from the cutting-edge knowledge presented at Innovate4Cities, expert knowledge and good practice. The subprogramme also ensured that the outcomes of the Innovate4Cities conference and recommendations contained in World Cities Report 2024 informed the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on climate change and cities.",

In response, the Government of Ethiopia launched a durable solutions initiative in 2019, providing a framework for multisectoral programme support for the return, relocation and local integration of internally displaced persons. In 2024, the subprogramme completed a report on the legal, policy and institutional frameworks for housing, land and property rights in the Oromia and Somali regions, providing a foundational analysis for advancing durable solutions. More than 116 regional, zonal and district officials have been trained on durable solutions, housing, land and property rights, mainstreaming internally displaced persons into planning and budgeting, solid waste management, and geographical information systems and remote sensing-based early warning and monitoring systems. As a result of this support, two settlement plans have been finalized, with six others undergoing consultation. The subprogramme also co-delivered, with displacement-affected communities and civil society organizations, solutions for wind and flood protection through tree-planting initiatives and distributed solid waste management equipment and awareness-raising materials in local languages across six sites. The subprogramme contributed to increasing the capacities of seven local and two regional administrations to enhance displacement-affected communities’ access to housing, land and property rights.",

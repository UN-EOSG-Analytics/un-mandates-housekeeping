By resolution 2769 (2025), the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Libya was renewed until 15 May 2026. In its resolution 2733 (2024), the Council requested the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya within 6 months and 11 months of the adoption of the resolution. The Secretary-General submitted his first report on 26 November 2024 (S/2024/858), while the second report was submitted on 25 April 2025 (S/2025/257). By its resolution 2745 (2024), the Security Council changed the name of the Panel of Experts on the Central African Republic to the Panel of Experts pursuant to resolution 2745 (2024) and decided to lift the arms embargo on the Government of Central African Republic and to continue to apply the arms embargo to armed groups and associated individuals operating in the Central African Republic. The Security Council resolution 2744 (2024) replaced the delisting procedure set out in resolution 1730 (2006), and requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Informal Working Group of the Security Council on General United Nations Security Council Sanctions Issues, to appoint the Focal Point within three months of the adoption of the resolution, to implement all of the mandates of the original Focal Point established pursuant to resolution 1730 (2006). It also expanded the mandate of the original Focal Point to deal with cases of false or mistaken identity or confusion with individuals included on Committee sanctions lists. Included under thematic cluster III, the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia continued to support the parties that signed the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace to implement that agreement. The Mission accompanied the Government in the formulation of the Rapid Response Plan adopted in October 2024 to accelerate the implementation of the Final Agreement, which includes the establishment of pacts between national and local authorities to accelerate the implementation of the Development Programmes with a Territorial Focus and to enhance their transformative potential in conflict-affected regions; as well as actions related to the comprehensive rural reform and security guarantees, among others.

In view of the low percentage of female national staff within the Mission, UNAMA is continuously undertaking efforts to address challenges that prevent the attainment of gender parity through capacity-building of women. The national United Nations Volunteers play a critical role in the mission's activities both in substantive and mission-support sections, and are essential for achieving and maintaining UNAMA's mandate, including by integrating Afghan women's perspectives in all areas of work and enhancing the Mission’s capacity to reach local communities and the most vulnerable groups. In line with the efforts to continue to improve the gender balance in the Mission’s staffing, and taking into account the prospects of shrinking extrabudgetary resources, it is proposed that the existing nine female national United Nations Volunteer positions currently funded from extrabudgetary resources be converted to regular budget funding in 2026, to continue to support programmes of work of components across the Mission. The conversion provides some element of assured continuity in this flagship initiative which supports the advancement of women's involvement in society and support UNAMA's gender parity efforts to employ and empower young professional Afghan women who would otherwise be struggling to find professional purpose in their lives after graduation.",

The implementation of the Staff Selection 2.0 initiative is well underway, aiming to foster a fair, efficient, effective, and agile recruitment system. This initiative is expected to significantly enhance the Secretariat’s ability to attract and select staff from a wide geographical base.  Concurrently, the Secretariat has recalibrated its talent attraction approaches, including through the development of purposeful partnerships with Member States. These efforts are aimed at positioning the United Nations as an employer of choice and at cultivating diverse talent pipelines to meet both current and future workforce needs. This forward-looking approach is designed to ensure a continuous flow of qualified candidates and to strengthen workforce readiness. While substantive change will require time, incremental progress is anticipated in the short to medium term. The Secretariat underscores the importance of adequate resources to sustain and scale talent outreach initiatives. Additional investments would enhance the Secretariat’s capacity to engage meaningfully with Member States and to implement outreach activities in support of equitable geographical distribution.",

These deputies constitute the link between the political work of the special political mission and the United Nations entities implementing development and humanitarian activities in coordination with the mission. As Resident Coordinator, the incumbent is responsible for coordinating operations and activities relating to the United Nations country team and United Nations development activities, for ensuring that the activities of the United Nations country team are aligned with national priorities, as captured in United Nations cooperation frameworks, for providing oversight and transparency on joint activities of the United Nations country team and for mobilizing partnerships and financing in support of country efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The office of the resident coordinator supports those functions. As Humanitarian Coordinator, the incumbent is responsible for coordinating humanitarian plans and operations and for maintaining links with Governments and other parties, donors and the broader humanitarian community. The salaries and common staff costs related to the posts of Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator are budgeted at 50 per cent of the total cost in the 2025 budgets of the respective special political missions, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 59/296 and 72/279, with the other 50 per cent funded through the Development Coordination Office.

The above-mentioned decrease reflects an estimated efficiency of $0.7 million based on the new budgetary policy in line with historical flight hour utilization rates mostly for UNOWAS, UNOCA, UNMHA and UNSMIL. In addition, the decrease is the result of: (a) the non-provision of resources for air operations in the liquidation of UNAMI as the current aircraft contract will be discontinued in 2025;  and (b) reduced requirements in UNAMA due to lower fuel consumption rate, reflecting lower estimated volume of 411,500 litres of fuel for the replacement aircraft at an average price of $1.318 per litre, compared with 904,000 litres at an average price of $1.291 per litre in the approved budget for 2025, offset by higher rental and operational costs, in connection with the proposed replacement of the B-1900D fixed-wing aircraft with a SAAB-340B at a higher contractual price. The decrease is offset in part by increased requirements for the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia based on the latest contractual prices for helicopters with increased guaranteed fleet costs, and to additional flight hours for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and related aviation fuel necessary to support broader mandate implementation in the locations outside Bogota and ensure connectivity between locations.",

Expert panels established pursuant to the administrative instruction on the staff assessment system (ST/AI/2010/3/Rev.3) are an integral part of the roster-based recruitment system. The expert panels assess and recommend candidates who have applied for generic job openings for posts in field missions in order to reduce the administrative burden on individual hiring managers and enhance the quality, consistency and integrity of the recruitment process by centralizing the assessment. They also assist the Human Resources Services Division in the Department of Operational Support in undertaking the assessment of applicants for generic job openings. Expert panels are similar in constitution to an assessment panel and will continue to convene in 2026 to assess and recommend candidates who have applied for generic job openings for positions in the field. As outlined in the administrative instruction on the staff selection system, the expert panels are normally comprised of at least three members, with two being subject matter experts at the same or higher level of the job opening, at least one being a woman and one being from outside the work unit where the job opening is located, who will undertake the assessment of applicants for a job opening. Roster selections are a proven tool to reduce recruitment timelines and front-load a fair assessment process. In 2024, 76 per cent of selections for international positions (FS-4 to D-1) in field missions (special political missions and peacekeeping operations) were from rosters, compared to the rate 50 percent in the global UN Secretariat for roster selections.",

Missions were requested to carefully review the requirements for their air assets and to maximize opportunities for the sharing of air assets across missions, with the support of the Department of Operational Support. In terms of flight hours, missions that utilized 90 per cent or more of the number of flight hours approved for the most recent performance period (2024) can propose maintaining the same number of flight hours approved for that performance period in the relevant categories (rotary or fixed-wing). For missions that utilized less than 90 per cent of the approved flight hours, the proposed flight hours are based on the higher of the average utilization percentage of the three most recent performance periods (2022, 2023 and 2024) and the utilization percentage of the most recent performance period (2024). The higher of those two percentages is then applied to the number of flight hours approved for the most recent performance period (2024) to obtain the proposed flight hours. Limited exceptions to this guidance may be considered on a case-by-case basis, should compelling justifications be provided. To provide missions with flexibility for their operating environment, total flight hours according to the policy may be distributed between the categories as required by the mission. A delayed deployment of 50 per cent is applied for new aircraft, with exceptions considered for the significant reconfiguration of an aviation fleet.",

The decrease was offset in part additional requirements: (a) for military observers owing to an increase in the  mission subsistence allowance rates and the applications of lower vacancy rates in UNMHA and the UN Verification Mission in Colombia; (b) for air operations in the UN Verification Mission in Colombia to support broader mandate implementation in the locations outside Bogota and ensure connectivity between location; and (c) for facilities and infrastructure for the construction of a new road and parking area, fuel station, construction of the infrastructure networks and other security enhancements in UNSMIL.",

The proposed budget reflects reduced requirements due primarily to the transfer of 42 posts (40 from current tenant units reporting to DOS, and two seconded military planning officer posts reporting to DPO) to the budgets of their parent offices in the support account. The reduced requirements are offset in part by (a) the application of lower vacancy rates for international, national professional and national general service staff compared to the vacancy rates applied in the approved budget for the 2024/25 period (b) the application of higher salary rates for national staff, (c) the application of updated exchange rate for the Ugandan shilling to the United States dollar, and (d) an increase in operational costs mainly for safety and security unit requirements; and higher rates for new systems contracts.",

As such, missions are implementing measures to improve energy, solid waste and wastewater management with technical assistance from DOS, and are reporting environmental performance data in the common environmental action planning and performance (eAPP) platform, culminating in the issuance of annual mission environmental scorecards available for Member States. \nIn the UN Verification Mission in Colombia, the solar power system planned to be installed during 2025 will generate increased efficiencies in electrical power generation and reduce energy costs and carbon footprint. In BINUH, the installation of a solar power system has enabled since January 2023 to offset 17.2 tons of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The Mission started a campaign to prohibit the use of single-use plastics on mission grounds and continued the implementation of vehicle idling policies to save fuel and reduce pollution. To save fuel in Hudaydah, UNMHA has installed a PV-diesel hybrid system that combines solar power from a photovoltaic system with the generators, saving 19 per cent of power consumption and approximately 3,500 litres of fuel per month. The Field Remote Infrastructure Monitoring implemented allow to detect eventual leakages and monitor water and fuel consumption. Other measures implemented by UNMHA and OSESGY include the usage of energy saving efficient LED lights, inverter-type AC units, and motion sensors. UNAMA has wastewater treatment plants to minimize the risk of contaminated water and recycles treated wastewater for gardening purpose, and has also installed Solar Power systems and conserves power through improved management and awareness campaign to minimise the use of fossil fuel, resulting in a reduction of carbon emissions. UNSCOL is working collaboratively with UNIFIL on the environmentally responsible disposal of decommissioned equipment, and prioritizing resource efficiency, including paper recycling and the installation of LED lighting. UNSMIL completed the installation of solar streetlights in the compound in Tripoli with the yearly consumption of 12,300 KWhr and will implement Solar Power projects for the Prefab offices with capacity of 100 KW in 2025; and will continue the Solar Power Project for offices in 2026 to reduce the environmental footprint of the mission. Quarterly beach cleaning campaign is conducted for reducing the environmental footprint on the waste management. The initiatives implemented by UNTMIS included the expansion of the renewable energy base from 9 per cent to 23 per cent following the expansion of solar panels in mission site in Mogadishu and connection of the site at Baidoa to KUBE Solar Power plant, utilization of LED light, efficient Air Conditioners, light motion sensors, and diesel generator synchronization, resulting in an environmental performance of 86%.",

In these cases, ad hoc operational support and the respective recovery/sharing of costs is provided on a need basis, ensuring coordination for transportation, security and other administrative matters.   \nBy fostering cooperation across the UN system, the Office of the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes seeks to maximize the impact of its work and contribute to greater organizational efficiency. In BINUH the efforts in place to strengthen integration include joint participation by the mission and the United Nations Country Team in the key policymaking and strategy forums, and collaboration through joint programmes and teams in areas including community violence reduction, justice, elections and police reform. \nCTED has continued to coordinate closely with UNOCT and UNODC to ensure distinct but mutually reinforcing roles in supporting Member States' efforts to counter terrorism.

Improved coordination and communication between departments have been prioritized, particularly for routine business-as-usual meetings, to synchronize travel plans effectively.\nThe Verification Mission in Colombia has made a conscious effort to reduce exceptions to the 21-day policy, having implemented a portal dedicated to submitting such requests and subdelegating internally to properly monitor requests.\nThe DPPA-supported Cluster II SPMs have improved their compliance with the 16-day advance booking policy due to better planning of travel missions and better communication with experts, Committees and Member States on the importance of compliance with the policy.

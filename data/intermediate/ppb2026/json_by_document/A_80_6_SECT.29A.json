With regard to appointments under the purview of the Fifth Committee, the component launched the e-Candidatures module in time for the elections held in November 2024. Feedback from surveys highlighted favourably the use of the e-Submit module and the available information on elections and appointments.

This simplified inscription for Member States through a single point of entry, and allowed for the provision of up-to-date live lists, indicating position of speakers, for use by the Chair and delegations, and consolidated information, including on officials introducing reports.

This simplified inscription for Member States through a single point of entry, and allowed for the provision of up-to-date live lists, indicating position of speakers, for use by the Chair and delegations, and consolidated information, including on officials introducing reports.

This simplified inscription for Member States through a single point of entry, and allowed for the provision of up-to-date live lists, indicating position of speakers, for use by the Chair and delegations, and consolidated information, including on officials introducing reports. In applying the lesson, the component will review workflows to improve the availability of information relevant to the work of the Committees on the public websites and e-deleGATE and, where necessary, work with relevant offices to consolidate and harmonize information sources to further facilitate Member States’ participation in deliberations.",

In 2024, the component introduced two changes in the timeline of the presentation of some resource requirements which mitigated this shortcoming. First, the component included in the proposed programme budget the estimated resource requirements related to the mandates to be renewed by the Human Rights Council during the year, rather than in the revised estimates report later in the session. Second, unlike in prior years, the recosting report was issued in September 2024 before the start of the main part of the session, in line with Assembly resolution 78/252. These changes resulted in increased visibility for Member States on the overall resources requirements of the proposed programme budget by the time the Secretary-General introduced the proposal to the Fifth Committee in mid-October.",

In 2024, the component introduced two changes in the timeline of the presentation of some resource requirements which mitigated this shortcoming. First, the component included in the proposed programme budget the estimated resource requirements related to the mandates to be renewed by the Human Rights Council during the year, rather than in the revised estimates report later in the session. Second, unlike in prior years, the recosting report was issued in September 2024 before the start of the main part of the session, in line with Assembly resolution 78/252. These changes resulted in increased visibility for Member States on the overall resources requirements of the proposed programme budget by the time the Secretary-General introduced the proposal to the Fifth Committee in mid-October.",

In 2024, the component introduced two changes in the timeline of the presentation of some resource requirements which mitigated this shortcoming. First, the component included in the proposed programme budget the estimated resource requirements related to the mandates to be renewed by the Human Rights Council during the year, rather than in the revised estimates report later in the session. Second, unlike in prior years, the recosting report was issued in September 2024 before the start of the main part of the session, in line with Assembly resolution 78/252. These changes resulted in increased visibility for Member States on the overall resources requirements of the proposed programme budget by the time the Secretary-General introduced the proposal to the Fifth Committee in mid-October.",

The component provided ongoing authoritative policy advice and interpretation on field-related allowances and benefits.

To embed enterprise risk management as a vital management tool across the Secretariat, the Umoja enterprise risk management module was developed and implemented in several phases, commencing in October 2021. As a key enabler of a strong accountability system, the module strengthens enterprise risk management by enhancing the quality of risk assessments, supporting the development of effective risk mitigation plans and improving integration between risk management and internal controls. It also facilitates robust monitoring of evolving risk profiles at both the corporate and entity levels. Furthermore, its data analytics capabilities provide valuable insights for analysing the Secretariat’s overall risk profile.",

The subprogramme organized regular awareness-raising activities in different formats: town halls, live talks, dialogues, brown bag discussions and training courses on anti-racism, to inform, educate and equip personnel with practical tools. The subprogramme has commenced making alignments in the staff selection process, specifically with projects to support “blind-hiring” practices, require “diversity in hiring panels” and update training and guidance provided to hiring teams on reducing racial bias in recruitment. The subprogramme also intensified advocacy and strengthened processes with stakeholders involved in the administration of justice to create a safe environment for reporting allegations of racism, expediting investigations and enhancing racial justice mechanisms.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will focus on building a staff-facing dashboard on staff composition and movements of personnel. The subprogramme will also be able to collect race-related data from staff and job applicants on a voluntary basis for the purpose of understanding workforce composition. The subprogramme will further strengthen the Organization’s staff selection processes by working towards mandating diversity in selection panels, promoting blind-hiring practices and building common assessment methods.",

The Chief of Service acts as principal interlocutor with Member States to address sensitive concerns and challenges and to liaise with the United Nations Treasury and the Controller to resolve issues and optimize the financial position of Member States with respect to the United Nations. \nThe Chief of Service also oversees other revenue-generating activities, including global cost-recovery operations and other ad hoc initiatives jointly funded with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes not covered by section 31 of the programme budget. \nIn respect of the Chief of Service’s role and responsibilities, it should be noted that the Committee on Contributions is one of the subsidiary organs of the General Assembly, and that the secretaries of such bodies are consistently positioned at the Director level. The Chief of Service is pivotal in developing measures to tackle the systemic liquidity challenges faced by the Organization to safeguard its financial health. Cost-recovery arrangements in the Secretariat continue to grow in value and complexity, encompassing a vast range of services (more than 3,000) and over 75 service providers. In recent years, the changing operational environment and the Organization’s increasing use of cost recovery as a financing model for several activities have highlighted the need to ensure that cost recovery is based on consistent principles, and that it applies approved methodologies, uses processes that are compliant with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and conforms to good practices that are generally accepted for such activities.",

Further to the original purpose of the position, the Senior Programme Management Officer also leads the Organization’s actions to provide ongoing support to victims of domestic abuse and violence. The Officer leads and facilitates discussions on this subject at the inter-agency level geared towards determining a consistent and victim-centred approach, and works in close collaboration with the Office of the Victims’ Rights Advocate to ensure that a consistent approach to dealing with victims is followed. The Officer supports and leads the review and realignment of existing policies and other administrative documentation with a view towards enabling the proactive exercise of the duty of care with regard to those victims. Given the ongoing and continuous nature of the temporary P-5 position, initially created in 2010, its conversion to a post is proposed based on the rationale provided above.",

              "text": "The position of Legal Officer, initially created in 2012, primarily represents the Secretary-General in United Nations Dispute Tribunal proceedings, which include extensive contact with client offices to receive instructions on facts, the preparation of written legal submissions and attendance at oral hearings. In addition, the Legal Officer is critical for providing legal advice to managers to mitigate risks in decision-making. This requires hands-on and frequent interaction with decision makers who are accountable for the direction and overall management of the resources of the Organization. Conversion of the Legal Officer position to a post is required because the number of cases handled by the component has remained consistently high and has required an ever-increasing amount of work to meet the requirements set out in the system of administration of justice, including, in particular, the representative functions needed to fully service a robust Dispute Tribunal docket. Given the spotlight placed on accountability and enforcement, the Secretariat’s view is that it is clear that the functions of the Legal Officer will remain fully engaged in this area of work for the foreseeable future, thus further substantiating the request for conversion.",

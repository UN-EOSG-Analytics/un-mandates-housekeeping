The decrease was offset in part by additional requirements: (a) for military observers owing to an increase in the mission subsistence allowance rates and the application of lower vacancy rates in UNMHA and the UN Verification Mission in Colombia; (b) for air operations in the UN Verification Mission in Colombia to support mandate implementation in the locations outside Bogota and ensure connectivity between location; and (c) for the construction of a new road and parking area, fuel station, infrastructure networks and other security enhancements in the UNSMIL complex.",

The Mission will also support legal framework development for the rule of law and security governance, facilitate coordination on force generation, training, and accountability, and contribute to a national maritime security strategy. Additionally, capacity-building initiatives in 2026 will address barriers to women’s professional development in the rule of law sector and promote gender sensitivity among decision-makers. Further efforts will focus on federated policing, justice, and corrections models, promoting judicial independence, civilian oversight, and accountability to enhance access to justice, particularly in fragile areas. Coordination with AUSSOM and national capacity development will also be strengthened. These tasks will progressively be handed over to the appropriate national authorities and to the United Nations country team and international partners by 31 October 2026, according to a transition roadmap to be agreed with the Federal Government of Somalia.",

The decrease is offset in part by increased requirements under: (a) facilities and infrastructure, due to additional requirements for the construction of a new road and parking area, fuel station, construction of the infrastructure networks and other security enhancements in connection with Phase 2 of the planned security enhancements works in the Mission’s compound; and (b) new requirements for the quick-impact projects mentioned in paragraph ‎174 above.",

The increased requirements are offset in part by: (a) reduced requirements for international staff owing to lower estimated common staff costs (estimated common staff costs as a percentage of salary costs of 51.7 per cent compared to 56.8 per cent in the 2025 budget); (b) reduced requirements for national staff owing to the application of higher vacancy rates for National Professional Officers and Local level staff; (c) reduced requirements for consultants owing to the higher reliance on in-house expertise; (d) reduced requirements under facilities and infrastructure owing to lower estimated costs for the rental of premises and non-acquisition of furniture; (e) lower estimated costs for rental of vehicles owing to efficiencies gained through the full transfer of rental of vehicles to the United Nations fleet modality; (f) fewer acquisition of communication and information technology equipment; (g) lower requirements for medical services; (h) lower requirements for freight due to fewer acquisition; and (i) lower requirements under other services, owing to a planned reduction in meeting facilitation, as a cost avoidance measure.",

The construction of the site will commence in 2025. Once an initial UNMHA presence is established and operational, UNMHA expects to increase the number of monitoring patrols to the frontline and enhanced engagement with the local authorities and communities within the mandate area. Further transition to full operating capability is planned to take place in 2026, which will provide additional opportunities for cooperation with local partners in implementing the Hudaydah Agreement and further strengthen trust towards the Mission.",

These findings also highlighted expanded avenues for cooperation with the United Nations country team that would allow UNMHA to build upon its role as a technical resource for the United Nations family in Hudaydah as appropriate.

The decreased costs were offset in part by: (a) application of a lower vacancy rate of 85.3 per cent for the United Nations monitors compared to 87.3 per cent in 2025; (b) establishment of the P-4 and P-3 posts lower vacancy rate for the United Nations monitors: (b) the establishment of additional international and Local level posts and revised salary scales in Amman; (c) additional acquisition of prefabricated facilities and accommodation, acquisition of generators and electric equipment, increased maintenance services for Al-Khawkah camp and increase in Security Services; (d) increased repairs and maintenance of ground fleet; (e) increased requirements for aviation fuel and increased air navigation charges.",

BINUH developed a political strategy addressing six areas of support: (a) facilitating an inclusive national dialogue; (b) supporting electoral and constitutional reforms; (c) enhancing public security; (d) strengthening the rule of law; (e) improving governance and institutional capacity; and (f) fostering United Nations system integration and regional partnerships. Implementation of the strategy and support on strategic communications is reported to the Security Council through the reports of the Secretary-General on a quarterly basis.

These repeated changes in Haitian leadership coincided with a marked escalation in gang violence, which in November 2024 led to the closing of the international airport, the suspension of all commercial flights and a flight ban imposed by the United States Federal Aviation Administration over Haitian airspace. The United Nations Department of Safety and Security subsequently authorised the evacuation of Programme Criticality 2 (PC 2) personnel from the capital and the relocation of PC 1 and PC 2 personnel to the regions outside Port-au-Prince. The Designated Official, in consultation with the Security Management Team, decided to retain a ceiling of 133 UN personnel in the capital based on the assessed extraction capacity by air and road. Under this ceiling, BINUH maintains a skeleton team of 17 personnel headed by the Special Representative. Skeleton Team personnel are replaced by a pool of 51 international staff rotating on the rest and recuperation cycle every four weeks while the remaining international staff work remotely. Following this second evacuation in November 2024, the Secretary-General launched a strategic assessment and advised the Security Council on the full range of options for continued United Nations efforts in Haiti, which include increasing the robustness of BINUH to stay and deliver and establishing a UN logistic support office for the multinational security support Mission that would operate separately from BINUH.",

The updated Mission Concept will prioritise BINUH’s mandated tasks and resources to be cost-effective in the prevailing operating environment. It will include recommendations to rationalize the mission’s structure, size and activities to ensure safe and effective mandate implementation. The Mission Concept review is expected to be largely completed in June 2025, prior to the Security Council’s consultations on the mission’s mandate extension in mid-July 2025. The Mission Concept will be finalized within three weeks after the issuance of the new mandate.

The mission supported the Haitian National Police in developing a roadmap for the elaboration of a multi-year strategic development plan aimed at strengthening institutional and operational capacities, promoting the rule of law, and enhancing security. The international community has also been actively engaged in efforts to professionalize the Haitian National Police. Advocacy supported by BINUH, for a UNDP-managed multi-donor basket fund has disbursed $14.1 million as of 31 December 2024, including commitments and advances, out of the initial allocated budget of $25.5 million, corresponding to an implementation rate of 54.4 per cent. In addition, a two-year extension (2024-2026) has been granted to the basket fund to allow for the achievement of expected outcomes and the full disbursement of remaining funds. However, the implementation of the planned activities in 2024 has faced delays, primarily due to operational constraints resulting from the worsening security situation and the closure of the international airport.",

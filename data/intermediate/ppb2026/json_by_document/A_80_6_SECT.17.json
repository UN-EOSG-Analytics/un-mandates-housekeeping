Moreover, UN-Women continues to improve its environmental sustainability policy with the aim of integrating its operational environmental guidelines, internal policies and procedures into a comprehensive corporate environmental sustainability framework. UN-Women is continuously adapting its cloud strategy by using cloud-based platforms to centralize environmental data and improve collaboration across the organization. By eliminating data centres at headquarters and country offices and managing all information technology infrastructure in the cloud, UN-Women has significantly reduced the environmental impact of its information technology operations. In addition, UN-Women has been promoting remote work and virtual meetings to reduce its carbon footprint. The organization has also enhanced its use of videoconferencing and other online collaboration tools for meetings involving remote offices to help to reduce travel. Furthermore, UN-Women has implemented enterprise resource planning and workflow automation solutions, along with digital signature solutions and digital document management systems, to continuously reduce paper usage.",

Senior management remains committed to the implementation of the advance purchasing and travel policy. In 2024, UN-Women achieved a 72 per cent compliance rate for travel tickets financed by regular budget resources, a significant improvement from the 2023 compliance rate of 31 per cent. This progress reflects better oversight and integration of travel planning into each division’s annual workplan. Despite these improvements, compliance remains affected by last-minute travel requests from Governments, civil society and other partners for UN-Women officials to attend events, resulting in late bookings that hinder full adherence to advance booking policies. To address challenges associated with advance planning for travel, UN-Women has reinforced travel oversight and advance planning, requiring senior management approval with justification for late travel requests. To further improve cost efficiencies and advance planning, UN-Women has introduced a new protocol, where business class tickets will not be issued for tickets purchased less than 21 days in advance, even for entitled travelers. UN-Women remains focused on optimizing travel spending through strengthened risk management measures and policy enforcement, ensuring efficient resource utilization while supporting the organization’s mission.",

The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) is responsible for promoting the economic and social development of its member States, fostering intraregional integration and promoting international cooperation for the development of Africa. ECA is mandated to operate at the regional and subregional levels to harness United Nations assets and bring them to bear on Africa’s priorities. ECA places a special focus on collecting up-to-date and original regional statistics in order to ground its policy research and advocacy in clear objective evidence; promoting policy consensus; and providing capacity development and advisory services. The Department of Global Communications raises international awareness of the economic, political and social situation in Africa, as well as the efforts made by Africa, the United Nations and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the region in pursuit of the goals of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the achievement of the Goals. The mandates of the Office, ECA and the Department derive from the priorities established in relevant resolutions and decisions, including General Assembly resolutions 32/197, 57/7, 57/300, 61/296, 66/293 and 76/236 and Economic and Social Council resolutions 671 (XXV) A and 1998/46.",

To this end, the programme will continue to engage with partners and stakeholders to advance its new narrative on Africa – one that reflects and strengthens Africa’s role as a key stakeholder and a vital player in the global arena; that brings to the global debate issues that are key for Africa’s development, such as domestic resource mobilization, energy access and digitalization; and that is of Africa and from Africa, to be fully embraced within the United Nations and beyond.",

Governance, financing and country systems are critical levers for ensuring stability, promoting growth and mitigating the risks of armed conflict. Recognizing the complex interplay between these factors, the subprogramme developed a conceptual framework to provide African government officials with actionable insights to strengthen governance and development practices. This work was informed by the subprogramme’s key knowledge production outputs across the past three years. Building on this groundwork, the subprogramme launched an innovative self-paced online training course in 2024. Through a flexible learning format and by integrating theoretical foundations with practical data-driven analysis tools, the course gave participants a holistic understanding of leveraging governance, financing and country systems to address peace and development challenges. Since its launch, the course has reached officials from 26 countries across Africa. Early results from pre- and post-course assessments demonstrated a 30 per cent increase in participants’ knowledge, highlighting the effectiveness of the training in equipping decision makers with the skills and understanding necessary to integrate the interlinked conceptual framework into policymaking.",

However, 95 per cent of employed young Africans work in the informal sector (International Labour Organization, 2023), which presents a significant challenge to realizing this goal. To drive transformative growth and enhance resilience, Africa must shift its economies and supply chains towards high-value services and industries. This requires strong education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, as well as robust science, technology and innovation ecosystems, to integrate young Africans into the formal sector, supported by policies that recognize the interconnectedness of decent jobs, education and social protection. To foster sustainable socioeconomic transformation, indigenous knowledge and models should be embraced and aligned within broader development frameworks.",

The implementation plan underscores lessons from the first decade of implementation, emphasizing the importance of accountability, democracy, justice and human rights in governance.

The discussions focused on themes critical to Africa, including gender equality, addressing hate speech, financing for climate action and the debt challenge. The series, which provided a global platform for African leaders and activists, culminated in a youth town hall that was produced in collaboration with the African Union and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service and featured the Special Envoy on Youth of the African Union, along with youth advocates from across the continent. The town hall served to amplify the voices of African youth on climate action and economic development. On 30 September, the Africa youth town hall aired on the BBC “Focus on Africa” programme. The subprogramme also secured media partnerships with other broadcasters, helping to further expand audience engagement with the discussion series.",

The Commission provides a regional intergovernmental platform to promote sustainable approaches, solutions and innovation pertaining to economic integration and trade, transport and mobility, environmental protection and management of natural resources, forests and the forest industry, affordable and clean energy, competitiveness and public-private partnerships, emerging social and demographic challenges and land management, while strengthening member States’ capacities to measure progress towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and their access to timely and quality evidence for informed policymaking. ECE will support member States’ commitment to take bold, ambitious, accelerated, just and transformative actions to implement the 2030 Agenda, achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind, as reiterated in the Pact for the Future. Considering its regional nature and membership of 56 States, ECE remains uniquely positioned and will continue to leverage its core mandated functions, namely, policy dialogue, normative work and technical cooperation, in support of the realization of the ambitions of the peoples of the ECE region for a just and prosperous future for all. The support delivered by the Commission to member States is also provided through the regular programme of technical cooperation and Development Account projects.",

The forum, which featured several young leaders and entrepreneurs as speakers, addressed critical issues related to youth policy, education, empowerment and financing, underscoring the essential role of young people in driving sustainable development. The results of the discussions contributed to the Summit of the Future side event on the theme “Empowering youth for sustainable futures: intergenerational responsibility and skills for a just transition”, which facilitated intergenerational dialogue between youth, national Governments, experts in sustainability and education and the United Nations on the role of education in sustainable development and ways to equip youth with essential skills that align with evolving job market demands in sustainability sectors.",

Subsequently, the subprogramme built institutional and human capacities in requesting member States to utilize PIERS to develop infrastructure projects that are not only bankable but also sustainable.

Since 2022, gap analyses have been undertaken in three countries that were key inputs to the formulation of circular economy road maps, action plans and related national strategies in priority sectors and thematic areas, with a focus on the following: (a) fostering international production networks and value chains that comply with circularity principles and improve the ability of customers to trace the products they buy, contributing to increased transparency; and (b) addressing the responsible management of waste by helping countries to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse in line with ECE guidance (e.g., code of good practice for reducing losses in the handling of fresh fruit and vegetables along international supply chains).",

In 2026 the annual exchange on evaluation will foster the use of evaluation results to improve programme planning and internal processes, which will be documented in the 2025 annual report on evaluation presented to the Executive Committee. To improve data quality and use, the component will guide and support, in cooperation with substantive divisions, the operationalization of the Data Strategy of the Secretary-General for Action by Everyone, Everywhere, based on the ECE ICT strategy and substantive divisions’ related action plans. The component will support the United Nations reform implementation and accelerated action for implementing the 2030 Agenda and the outcomes of the 2024 Sustainable Development Goals Summit and of the 2024 Summit of the Future, as applicable, by improving system-wide coherence and coordination of programme delivery at the regional and country levels. This will be done, among others, through the facilitation of the implementation of the 2026 workplan of the Regional Collaborative Platform for Europe and Central Asia, ensuring a successful meeting of the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the ECE Region and continuing active engagement in the 17 programme countries in partnership with resident coordinator offices and United Nations country teams, including in the preparation of United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks, to be signed in 2026. Structured around the Goals, the 2025 technical cooperation report, to be presented to the Executive Committee, will include all the technical assistance provided to member States. The component will also continue to foster and mainstream a gender perspective by coordinating the implementation of the ECE gender action plan for 2025–2026, which will continue to act as the primary vehicle for implementation of the ECE policy for gender equality and the empowerment of women (2021–2025). In line with the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, executive direction and management will continue to mainstream disability inclusion into ECE work, by reporting on the implementation of the ECE disability inclusion action plan for 2025 and planning for 2027.",

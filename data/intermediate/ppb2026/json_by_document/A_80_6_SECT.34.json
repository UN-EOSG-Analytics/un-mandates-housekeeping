In 2023, the subprogramme piloted a more efficient digital badging solution for delegates, conference participants and visitors to the United Nations Office at Geneva. In 2024, this solution was rolled out extensively to almost all visitors to the Palais des Nations. Registered conference participants and visitors now receive a digital badge by email, consisting of their photo, a Quick Response (QR) code, their name and the date of their meeting or appointment. Operating in a similar manner to an airline electronic boarding pass, the digital badge, once downloaded to any mobile device, enables faster entry to the premises by dispensing with the time needed to create a “physical” badge and provides visitors with an easy and convenient solution to access the premises. This solution has also contributed towards the elimination of paper, metal and plastic waste and reductions in the lead time for the processing and issuance of badges.",

The principles of the cost-sharing arrangement were adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 56/255. Following the recommendation of the Assembly, in its resolution 61/263, on achieving a workable cost-sharing arrangement, the High-level Committee on Management of CEB agreed that field-related security costs would be apportioned on the basis of actual percentages of staff according to data provided by CEB. Subsequently, the Secretary-General outlined revised cost-sharing arrangements for the cost of the United Nations security management system (see A/62/641). In October 2021, the High-level Committee on Management endorsed a revision of the cost-sharing arrangement (see CEB/2021/HLCM/FB/5), effective from 2023, which, while preserving the principles adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 56/255, updated the membership fee, which had not been changed since its establishment; addressed the principle of equitability by having all organizations pay a membership fee and reinforced the notion of shared ownership for the system; and ensured that organizations in countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pay their fair share of the security costs. To inform future decisions on the United Nations security management system in the light of recent operational and funding shifts, the High-level Committee on Management has initiated an in-depth review of the system, led by an independent expert. The review started in March 2025 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with preliminary findings and recommendations to be delivered by June 2025. The review will examine a range of dimensions, including the system’s governance, functions, division of responsibilities and operating modalities.",

The decrease reflects adjustments in line with the level of resources endorsed by the Finance and Budget Network, taking into account the funding context within which United Nations entities operate, including the ongoing financial constraints faced by participating entities. The Network also agreed that no recosting or inflationary adjustments should be applied to the 2026 budget proposals for the United Nations security management system. Thus, the Department is planning significant adjustments to its footprint to comply with the recommendations and conclusions of the Network. In the field, these adjustments will translate into greater regionalization of functions, with more multi-country offices covering an expanded number of locations, increased nationalization of posts and the withdrawal of presence in the lowest-risk locations. At Headquarters, reductions may be achieved by consolidating both analytical and field support desk functions and pooling capacities where relevant and appropriate. Details of the footprint adjustments that will be required are not yet known, as the Department will be reviewing its presence in the coming months, location by location.",

As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on capital investment planning (A/79/510), a long-term dedicated team capacity is needed to centrally manage the project, provide technical oversight for security procurement processes, standardize security systems and components, and manage security assets at the global level. These requirements are crucial for safeguarding the Organization’s long-term security posture in an increasingly challenging environment, and represent a continuing requirement for the Organization beyond completion of the project, currently scheduled for 2031. Details of the functions to be performed by the incumbents of the above-mentioned posts are provided below.\nThe Senior Security Officer (P-5) would take the lead in the overall supervision and coordination of proposals for security projects, including functional and business requirements for safety and security, related system specifications and standardization, technical validation and project execution plans. The increasing scale, complexity and global scope of physical and electronic security investments necessitate dedicated, centralized leadership to ensure consistency, compliance with United Nations standards and the long-term sustainability of security infrastructure across all locations.\nThe Security Coordination Officer (P-4) would manage and coordinate the capital improvement projects, including upgrades to and major maintenance for security systems, from the design phase through the installation, monitoring and reporting phases. The incumbent would also identify and seek solutions to address any organizational gaps in managing common security projects and logistics, ensuring dedicated expertise and continuity in the financial, administrative and operational management of security enhancement projects across the United Nations in a consistent manner.",

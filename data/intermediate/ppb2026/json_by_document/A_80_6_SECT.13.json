Digital trade is the fastest-growing segment of international trade, with an estimated average annual growth rate of 8 per cent since 2005 and $4.3 trillion in value. Lack of access to financing is one of the key obstacles to the growth of women’s entrepreneurship in international trade. ITC launched the joint WTO-ITC Women Exporters in the Digital Economy Fund in February 2024. Operationalized through the ITC SheTrades initiative, the Fund aims to raise $50 million for thousands of women entrepreneurs in developing and least developed countries. The Fund will provide financing for women entrepreneurs, enabling them to adopt digital technologies and expand the online presence of their enterprises.",

The review pointed to several opportunities for better and more efficient utilization of financial and human resources, including through the reconfiguration of staffing structures, the repurposing of existing posts and the redistribution of non-post resources. The spending review proposals support the realization of the five transformational outcome priorities identified in the strategic plan for the period 2026–2030, namely: (a) the acceleration of trade diversification and value addition; (b) the advancement of the sustainable transition for small and medium-sized enterprises; (c) the enhanced inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises in the digital economy; (d) the achievement of transformational benefits from trade for small and medium-sized enterprises; and (e) the amplification of the contributions of small and medium-sized enterprises to global advocacy and decision-making. Through the spending review process, ITC aims to reinforce the strategic coherence of its operations and ensure that its resource base is positioned to respond to emerging priorities of Member States and unforeseen challenges over the coming period covered by the strategic plan.",

The ITC country engagement strategy is shaped by several key factors, namely: (a) the need for greater visibility and more direct engagement in country-level discussions; (b) the growing complexity of the ITC project portfolio, requiring stronger coordination at the country level; (c) the increasingly complex needs of countries; (d) the competitive Aid for Trade space, requiring ITC to demonstrate its unique value proposition; and (e) the decentralization of strategic and funding decisions by development partners.",

While the analysis resulted in negligible changes to the distribution of resources, all subprogramme managers placed renewed emphasis on the importance of supporting the participation of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States in face-to-face meetings relevant to the implementation of their programmes of action. In view of the level of non-post resources, compared with the broad scope of the programmes of action, the subprogramme managers reiterated that they regularly sought to collaborate, plan and align events across all subprogrammes, as well as with United Nations and other partner entities. Programme managers routinely pursue measures aimed at increasing efficiencies, such as organizing inter-agency consultative group meetings through Microsoft Teams and other virtual platforms, arranging back-to-back meetings, organizing meetings on cross-cutting issues for all three groups and using recorded messages of the High Representative, whenever appropriate or feasible, to make the most efficient use of resources by reducing travel costs and duration, while seeking to maximize participation.",

The main issue with the Office’s current structure identified during the review is one of imbalance. Subprogramme 1 (Least developed countries) has a total of 17 posts (14 Professional and 3 General Service). Two cross-cutting functional areas (the Policy Development and Coordination, Monitoring and Reporting Service and the Advocacy and Outreach Unit) are also located within subprogramme 1; the total number of posts of those areas comprise 1 Chief of Service (D-1), 4 Professional staff and 1 General Service (Other level) staff. Subprogramme 1 therefore comprises a total of 23 posts, which is more than half of all the Office’s posts (53.5 per cent). Drawing on standard evaluation criteria to understand and analyse an intervention (relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability), the independent review offered an informed assessment of the pros and cons of two alternative strategies: maintaining the status quo or restructuring the Office’s organization chart, which had remained unchanged since the Office was established. The independent review underscored the importance of a comprehensive, well-‍resourced and highly competent subprogramme 1. Nevertheless, maintaining the status quo would bring into question the adequacy of resourcing and input for subprogramme 2 (Landlocked developing countries), subprogramme 3 (Small island developing States) and the core functions of advocacy, outreach, research and analysis performed by the Office, which cover all three groups.",

The new Advocacy, Outreach and Analysis Section has been conceived as a horizontal, cross-cutting service entity that would deliver cross-cutting and distinct advocacy and analytical outputs, services and deliverables to the Office of the High Representative and to each of the other three subprogrammes. This proposal would entail the redeployment of five posts delivering cross-cutting services, as described in annex II. The independent review also recommended the redeployment of the Chief of Service (D-1) and one General Service (Other level) post from the Policy Development and Coordination, Monitoring and Reporting Service, which is also within subprogramme 1, to executive direction and management, given that the Chief is traditionally responsible for overseeing the work of all subprogrammes, not just that of subprogramme 1. As a result of the proposed changes, the Service would cease to exist, and the functions of the Advocacy and Outreach Unit would be redeployed to subprogramme 4. These redeployments would be enabled by the redistribution of functions within subprogramme 1 and from that subprogramme to the new subprogramme 4 and the absorption of cross-cutting functions by the new subprogramme. Moving the cross-cutting functions of advocacy and communication and the capacities in data analysis and research to a dedicated section under subprogramme 4 would increase effectiveness and synergies between workstreams and optimize the use of existing capacities to support the three groups of countries, individually and collectively, through a more seamless operational modality in which the Office’s strategic position is better utilized to address the shared challenges and key development issues facing the three groups of countries and the increased demand for the Office’s support to monitor the three programmes of action.",

While changes to the grades of existing posts were not recommended as a result of the spending review, subprogramme managers reiterated that a desirable outcome would be to move posts responsible for cross-cutting functions out of subprogramme 1. The review also involved an analysis of opportunities to strengthen future skill requirements, including in such areas as data analytics and management, strategic communications and strategic foresight, so that such requirements are fully considered and reflected, where appropriate, in the underlying job descriptions. The results of the spending review will enable the Office to deliver mandates more effectively in the future by strengthening workforce capabilities in the aforementioned areas and rejuvenating the workforce through the use of retirement projections.",

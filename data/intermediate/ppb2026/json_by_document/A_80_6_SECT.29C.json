Clear, comprehensive guidance to regulate the development and deployment of artificial intelligence can help to minimize ethical risks. In addition, high-quality, secure data are a prerequisite for the effective and reliable use of artificial intelligence. In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will develop a robust and comprehensive artificial intelligence management framework that can be applied across the Organization. It will include clear policies, procedures and standards for the responsible and ethical implementation of artificial intelligence. This approach will promote consistency, accountability and transparency in artificial intelligence practices and foster trust in data and artificial intelligence processes across the Organization.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will take a more proactive approach to adopting cloud-based solutions, ensuring that user workstations are properly managed through security policies. By modernizing workstation management and making the transition to a cloud-based solution, the subprogramme reduces risks associated with outdated on-premise infrastructure and increases the resilience of the Organization’s ICT systems.",

This would also enable efficient adaptation to a rapidly changing and expanded ICT security risk map and strengthen core capacity for proactive vulnerability and threat and incident management Secretariat-wide. Local ICT security operations in Nairobi and Bangkok would continue to be supported by the remaining existing ICT security capacity at those locations.",

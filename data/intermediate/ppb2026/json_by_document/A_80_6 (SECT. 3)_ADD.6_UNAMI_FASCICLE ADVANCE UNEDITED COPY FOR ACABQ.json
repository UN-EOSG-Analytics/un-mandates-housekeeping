The Mission intensified its facilitation of dialogue and progress towards the final resolution of outstanding issues between Iraq and Kuwait, in preparation to address the Security Council’s request to the Secretary-General to make recommendations for an ‘appropriate follow-on mechanism’. The Mission simultaneously began its work to prepare, in consultation with the Government of Iraq, the Secretary-General’s transition and liquidation plan for submission to the Security Council by 31 December 2024, which took into consideration three strategic transition priorities to guide the work of the United Nations system in Iraq as it phases out UNAMI: (a) effective mandate delivery; (b) transfer of tasks to ensure preservation of gains and sustained United Nations support; and (c) safe and gradual mission drawdown by the end of December 2025.",

A National Staff Capacity Building Programme was strategically designed to equip national staff with essential skills and support for successful career transitions ahead of mission closure. Key initiatives already implemented in 2024 and 2025 include: (a) the comprehensive assessment of staff skills, which considers the current skills and learning needs of staff and how this aligns to the local market; (b) job search and application training in collaboration with local recruiters, vocational and technical certifications such as the International Computer Driving License; and (c) entrepreneurial workshops by Business by Design, personalized career coaching, mentorship, and a Training Newsletter which provides up to date information on job opportunities across United Nations and non-United Nations entities. Other activities planned for 2025 include virtual and in-person career fairs, launching of a dedicated job platform application tool, and expanded vocational training and collaboration with the United Nations country team on  vocational training and business start-ups.",

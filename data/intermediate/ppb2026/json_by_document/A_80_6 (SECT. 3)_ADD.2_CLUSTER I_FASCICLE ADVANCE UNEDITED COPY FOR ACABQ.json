                    "text": "The mandate of the mission derives from an exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (S/2018/955 and S/2018/979), when the remit of the mandate of the former Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sudan and South Sudan was expanded to cover the entire Horn of Africa region, following previous exchanges of letters (including S/2016/258 and S/2016/259). In line with the letters of 2018, the mission also continues to carry out the functions previously performed by the Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan relating to the maintenance of good and peaceful neighbourly relations between the Sudan and South Sudan, established pursuant to the exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council in 2011 (S/2011/474 and S/2011/475). The mandate includes cooperation with the African Union High-level Implementation Panel in efforts to implement Security Council resolution 2046 (2012), in which the Council called upon the Sudan and South Sudan to reach an agreement on critical issues, including: (a) the full and urgent advancement of all outstanding issues from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; and (b) the easing of tensions and the facilitation of the resumption of negotiations on post-secession relations and the normalization of their relations. Furthermore, the mission works closely with and supports member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in line with the Joint Framework for Cooperation between the United Nations and IGAD signed in Djibouti on 17 November 2015, and other regional organizations in promoting peace and security across the Horn of Africa.",

Meetings were held with political, economic, and military representatives, as well as media, civil society, women and youth, across multiple governorates in Yemen and in the region to gather their feedback on political, economic and security issues. These activities occurred amidst growing regional and economic tensions, affecting essential financial services. On 23 July 2024, the mission announced that the parties agreed to measures to de-escalate tensions in the banking and air transport sectors. Additional complexities arose from the Houthis’ arbitrary detention of various UN, diplomatic and civil society personnel, leading to a severe restriction on civic space.

The talks provided an opportunity for engagement on concrete measures to improve the lives of civilians in the Sudan. These discussions also contributed to the development of options contained in the report of the Secretary-General on “Recommendations for the protection of civilians in the Sudan” (S/2024/759). To strengthen the mission’s outreach to and partnership with Sudanese civil society, in December the mission undertook a series of virtual consultations with representatives of Sudanese youth movements, women’s groups and other civil society actors on the protection of civilians to inform future discussions with the warring parties and ensure their outcome benefits local populations in the Sudan.",

The last global appeal was published in January 2024. The Office will continue this practice and continue its regular engagement with member states on priorities and needs related to voluntary contributions. However, given the current global financial climate, the Office is encountering challenges in mobilizing additional resources to fully support its core activities.\nThe Office of the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region diligently engages with its primary donors to secure voluntary contributions in support of the implementation of the Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework. In addition to its ongoing efforts to enhance fundraising strategies, the Office will engage with other similar special political missions and other United Nations entities to exchange lessons learned and best practices. This collaboration will help strengthen the Office’s approach to obtaining sufficient, predictable, and sustained levels of voluntary contributions, including unearmarked funding, as necessary. By leveraging insights from proven fundraising strategies, the office aims to improve its approach and increase the level of voluntary contributions from the current levels.\nThe Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen has aligned its resource mobilization efforts. In addition, the Office has put in place improved internal reporting on resources management that takes into consideration all funding extrabudgetary portals.\n",

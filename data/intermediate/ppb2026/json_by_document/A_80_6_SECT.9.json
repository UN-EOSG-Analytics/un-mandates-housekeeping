By the end of the 2020 census round in December 2024, 204 countries and areas had conducted a census. The subprogramme supported those censuses through organizing regional workshops, providing ad hoc technical assistance and emphasizing the use of digital technologies, including georeferencing and the integration of administrative data to enhance efficiency and data quality. Countries reported achievements in these areas such as successful budget management and timely data dissemination. Other achievements included increased use of census data for Sustainable Development Goals monitoring, geocoded census results and the adoption of international standards.

The subprogramme, in collaboration with custodian agencies, has supported national statistical offices through technical assistance, methodological guidance and training activities, leading to a nine-fold increase in data availability in the global indicator database, with data records rising from 330,000 in 2016 to 2.9 million by 2024.

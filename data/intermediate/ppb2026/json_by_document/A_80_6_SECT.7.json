It is composed of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council and is one of six principal organs of the United Nations and the principal judicial organ of the Organization. It functions in accordance with the Statute of the Court, which is an integral part of the Charter. All 193 States Members of the United Nations are Parties to the Statute, and 74 of them have recognized the Court’s jurisdiction as compulsory, in line with Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute. In addition, more than 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties grant the Court compulsory jurisdiction in the resolution of various types of disputes. States that are not members of the United Nations may become Parties to the Statute on conditions to be determined in each case by the Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The Court may also be open to States not Parties to its Statute, subject to the conditions laid down by the Security Council and set out in its resolution 9 (1946), adopted on 15 October 1946. The Court submits annual reports to the Assembly, the most recent of which is contained in document A/79/4. Under the terms of regulation 2.14 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, the programme budget proposals of the Court are prepared by the Court, in consultation with the Secretary-General, and are submitted to the Assembly by the Secretary-General, together with such observations as the latter may deem desirable.",

New cases are brought before the Court by States, and advisory opinions are requested of the Court by authorized organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, all of whom may seize the Court at any time. When a case is pending before the Court, it is not possible to anticipate whether and when recourse will be made to incidental proceedings (e.g. requests for provisional measures or interventions). Historically, there have been significant variations in the number of new proceedings commenced in a given year, although in recent times there has been an upward trend in the Court’s caseload. In order to meet the demands of its workload, the Court now routinely considers three cases simultaneously. In 2024, the Court was seized of four new cases, including one request for an advisory opinion, the fourth such request since 2023. In 2024, the Court also delivered four judgments, one advisory opinion and five orders on requests for the indication or modification of provisional measures. During the same period, the Court held nine sets of hearings, including two in advisory proceedings, one of which involved the participation of 96 States and 11 international organizations. With 26 cases pending on its General List as at 30 April 2025 – which involve, inter alia, 133 States Members of the United Nations – the Court will no doubt maintain its increased judicial workload in the years to come.",

In principle, the parties to cases brought before the Court each submit one set of written pleadings to the Court: a memorial and a counter-memorial. The Court may authorize them to submit a further set of pleadings, namely, a reply and a rejoinder. In practice, these additional pleadings are almost always submitted. The pleadings are tending to become increasingly voluminous, notwithstanding the Court’s appeals to the parties not to repeat arguments already exposed. Hearings can also be long and complex, depending on the nature of the case. In cases involving difficult factual issues (e.g. of a highly technical character), parties may call witnesses and experts to testify. In addition, in recent years, a number of States have intervened in contentious proceedings, including at hearings. Once it has heard the submissions of the parties, the Court delivers a decision within as short a time as possible, allowing for the complexity of the case. The entire proceedings must be conducted simultaneously in both of the Court’s official languages, English and French, both at the written and oral stages and during deliberations.",

All the members of the Court are, in principle, required to participate in every case before it (Article 25 of the Statute).

Between 2021 and 2024, the number of publications issued by the Court rose from 23 to 51, an increase of more than 120 per cent, and is expected to continue to increase steadily in 2025 and 2026 as a result of the publication of voluminous written pleadings in two recent advisory proceedings. Owing to a lack of internal capacity, the copy preparation and review of proofs of Court materials published in French is currently being outsourced to freelancers, under the supervision of the Head of the Publishing Division. A more permanent solution to enhance the Division’s capacity to mitigate delays and backlogs generated by the unprecedented surge in workload and build in-house expertise is required. The work performed by the incumbent would mirror that currently done by the Copy Preparer/ Proofreader (English) and ensure an improved and more balanced internal working structure. Although a reduction in temporary assistance for meetings resources is not expected in 2026 owing to the accumulated workload and current backlog in publications, the requested post is expected to lead to a reduction of resources required under temporary assistance for meetings in 2027.",

Once appointed, judges ad hoc take part in any decision concerning the case in terms of complete equality with members of the Court. In that regard, judges ad hoc, like their elected colleagues, are entitled to support from the Registry, including the legal assistance which is necessary for the exercise of their functions as judge ad hoc in the case(s) in which they have been nominated. The practice of the Court is to request a law clerk assigned to a member of the Court to also assist a judge ad hoc.\nWith the recent increase in the number of cases pending on the Court’s docket, the number of judges ad hoc has also increased, from 13 in 2018 to 19 as at 6 March 2025. The Court’s sustained judicial activity has also increased the workload of the law clerks assisting members of the Court, who are no longer able to provide the requisite level of assistance to judges ad hoc in addition to the tasks assigned to them by members of the Court.\nThe establishment of four posts of Associate Legal Officer in the Department of Legal Matters is requested to constitute a permanent pool of jurists to provide judges ad hoc with the legal support to which they are entitled to under the Court’s Statute.

The Court’s sustained judicial activity has led to an increased need to recruit and manage temporary staff, such as translators, interpreters and court reporters, often at short notice. The management of short-term language staff alone now accounts for 25.7 per cent of personnel actions handled by the Division. The volume of personnel actions, a key indicator of human resources activity, increased by 330 per cent between 2011 and 2024.\nIn addition, the Division’s responsibilities have expanded to include participating in all selection panels in an ex officio capacity, administering short-term language staff, members of the Court and ad hoc judges.\nDue to its limited resources, the Division has experienced delays in processing staff requests and the timely completion of recruitment processes, which often exceed the target duration of 120 days. The new post would enable the Division to address the higher workload and ensure the timely processing of staff requests in support of the Court’s ongoing operations.",

These areas are not patrolled by the private security company contracted by the Carnegie Foundation.\nIn the light of recent security incidents at the Peace Palace and the Court’s heightened public profile, the Registry requested the assistance of the Department of Safety and Security of the United Nations Secretariat in conducting an on-site physical security assessment of the Peace Palace.\nIn its report, the Department of Safety and Security observed that the Division’s current capacity (whose security staff include three General Service (Other level) security officers) was insufficient to cover the necessary operational needs, and recommended the creation of additional General Service (Other level) Security Officer posts to staff the security control room, including monitoring the closed-circuit television system on a continual basis, and to provide patrol and response capability in the New Wing and the Historical Building of the Peace Palace. In this regard, the establishment of four Security Officer posts is requested to provide the level of security required to adequately protect the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. ",

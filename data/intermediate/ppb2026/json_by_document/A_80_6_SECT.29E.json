Recently, the number of payment rejections and investigations has nearly tripled, rising from 785 cases in 2021 to 2,176 cases in 2024, and resulting in additional bank charges for clients. The subprogramme has identified that the increase in bank payment rejections and investigations is driven by factors such as stricter sanctions compliance, enhanced “know your customer” requirements, evolving anti-money-laundering regulations and the introduction of automated compliance monitoring systems. Those changes have heightened the need for detailed payment verification and strict adherence to regulatory frameworks.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will conduct a review of the most frequent causes of payment rejections and investigations, focusing on the largest clients, accounting for 83 per cent of cases. On the basis of the findings, tailored workshops will be developed to inform and educate clients, equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to meet evolving banking expectations, minimize payment delays and foster more secure and efficient transaction processes.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will develop and implement detailed maintenance plans for the daily operations of newly renovated buildings as they are handed over from the strategic heritage plan, including documentation of installed technologies and electrical systems. This proactive approach will help to support staff and client comfort in the modernized spaces, while safeguarding the significant investment made by Member States in upgrading the Palais.",

The subprogramme recognizes that Internet of things solutions can enhance campus operations by improving efficiency, enabling better decision-making and providing more effective resource management. However, to harness the full potential of the Internet of things, such technologies must be integrated into the Office’s information security framework to address risks such as system vulnerabilities, data breaches and privacy violations.",

In addition, information security risks associated with these solutions have grown significantly. In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will develop, in coordination with subprogramme 3, a comprehensive Internet of things implementation plan for 2026. This plan will outline how Internet of things technologies can be systematically deployed and managed to enhance operational efficiency while mitigating security and privacy risks, to provide a safer, more efficient and comfortable client experience.",

In applying the lesson, the subprogramme will review its metadata processes, which are crucial for producing accurate search results. Metadata systematically organizes information and describes archives and documents by capturing key themes, subjects and concepts. The review will incorporate current best practices and standards for metadata creation, including exploring the use of artificial intelligence prompting. By applying these findings, the subprogramme will enhance its processes, increase metadata output and ensure users benefit from faster, more accurate and comprehensive access to United Nations archives and official documents.",

In 2024, the steering group met twice to oversee and drive forwards progress on implementation of the environmental management system. The steering group, newly established in 2023, comprises senior representatives from the Office’s main divisions. The two main points for review in 2024 were the Office’s progress towards meeting the environmental objectives of the United Nations system and the Secretariat, and the Office’s new environmental action plans. Action plans are a key component of an environmental management system, and the Office has drafted these for its three main environmental impact areas: the use of energy at the Palais des Nations; waste management at the Palais; and the preservation of biodiversity in Ariana Park. The steering group will continue to meet twice annually until the Office’s environmental management system is fully established. The action plans are also a deliverable under the 2050Today charter, which the Office signed in 2023. In 2024, work continued on the energy centre, the project to heat the Palais des Nations using heat pumps that extract thermal energy from Lake Geneva water. Once completed, the energy centre is forecast to provide around 80 per cent of the heat requirement of the Palais des Nations from renewable sources, leading to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In line with the Secretary-General’s vision for United Nations 2.0, the Office is committed to introducing a forward-thinking culture with regards to environmental management. The Office has therefore been improving the collection and management of environmental data, to better support decision-making. Going forwards, the aim is to apply behavioural science to enable staff and visitors to contribute to environmental management at the Palais. The Office was also selected by the Sustainable United Nations team as a pilot entity to test a waste audit methodology for the United Nations system. Three days’ worth of office waste was analysed in detail, providing crucial insights into staff habits. The results of the audit should make it possible to reduce waste disposal costs and the impact on the environment.",

A recent review of the long-term needs of the United Nations Office at Geneva, as requested by the Advisory Committee in its report on the 2023 proposed programme budget (A/77/7, para. VIII.96), confirmed the permanent nature of the position. The Legal Officer plays a critical role in ensuring the Office’s capacity to represent and defend the Organization in the internal justice system, and this need is expected to continue. It is therefore proposed that it be converted from general temporary assistance to a post.\nThere are 2 P-4 Legal Officers in the Office, one being a regular budget-funded temporary position and the other being an extrabudgetary-funded post. The analysis of the distribution of functions between these two positions and the overall workload of the Legal Unit over a six-year period showed that the percentage of extrabudgetary-related workload is lower than 50 per cent in all categories. It further demonstrates the constant workload of handling 100 cases per annum. The main case categories include appeals to the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, United Nations Dispute Tribunal proceedings, conduct and discipline cases, and management evaluation requests. The incumbent of the P-4 Legal Officer post funded through extrabudgetary resources also handles cases involving staff members supported by the regular budget. This highlights the critical need for stable and long-term regular budget funding for the Unit. A summary table is provided below.",

The incumbent of the post proposed to be reassigned will be responsible for a team that leads connections with clients and access to collections.

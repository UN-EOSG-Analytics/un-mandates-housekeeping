A total of 914 intercommunal events were held between July 2023 and June 2024. In the buffer zone, notwithstanding a challenging environment and incidents of unauthorized activities, the operational focus of UNFICYP continued to be on the prevention and de-escalation of tensions.

The results highlighted that, while field offices were at the front line of the United Nations response to local conflicts, those interventions were often reactive in nature and disjointed in their implementation, undermining operational coherence.

Under the strategic guidance of the Head of Mission and Chief of Staff, and with the engagement of all managers and the Human Resources Services Division of the Department of Operational Support, a review was carried out of the mission’s operations. The review builds on previous process reviews undertaken by the mission to streamline support services across five countries and improve logistics support against the dynamically challenging areas of its operations, as well as lessons learned from the impact of the liquidity situation and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The mission was subject to a civilian staffing review that was jointly undertaken with the Department and included an in-depth analysis of the mission’s organizational structure, staffing composition and levels to determine optimal alignment with evolving mission priorities, enhance resource efficiency and effectiveness and ensure that staff possess the skills required to provide high-quality services, while incorporating succession plans and future operational needs. The review also included an analysis of historical trends in non-post resource spending and distribution over the past five years to identify opportunities for efficiencies and realignment to support optimal implementation of the mission’s mandate and achieving results, as set out in the proposed programme plan for 2026. The review pointed to several opportunities for better and more efficient utilization of financial and human resources.",

Fuel expenditure decreased in 2024 compared with the period 2020–2023, due primarily to the installation of solar panels at three locations, reducing dependence on fuel-powered generators. With plans to install solar panels at nine additional locations in 2025, further reductions in fuel consumption are anticipated in 2026. Consequently, the generator fuel budget for all 12 locations in 2026 is projected at 60,000 litres, down from 119,300 litres in 2024.

The initiative represents a crucial Internet of things-based platform tailored for real-time monitoring and management of essential resources (i.e. water, electricity and fuel) in remote areas. By facilitating precise and timely data collection, it allows UNTSO to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, analyse consumption trends and anticipate potential shortages. The integration of advanced data analytics significantly boosts operational efficiency by pinpointing areas for improvement, fostering sustainability and optimizing resource utilization. Robust reporting capabilities enhance transparency and accountability, ensuring effective communication with stakeholders. Field remote infrastructure monitoring also incorporates automation to refine resource management processes, such as refuelling generators and maintaining a steady power supply during critical operations. The system’s real-time monitoring capability allows for automated responses to fluctuating conditions, thereby improving operational readiness and efficiency while minimizing delays. Although the impact of field remote infrastructure monitoring may not always manifest itself in initial short-term cost reductions, its role in streamlining processes, improving decision-making and supporting sustainability initiatives optimizes resource management, enhances operational efficiency, minimizes waste over time and contributes to long-term operational savings and more effective resource utilization, ultimately reinforcing the overall objectives of the mission.",

Therefore, the present proposal concentrates the staffing resources of the Office of Military Affairs where they are most needed in support of military components of peacekeeping operations, namely, in the functions performed by the proposed Military Planning, Operations and Analysis Section, the Military Doctrine and Performance Section and the existing Military Force Generation Section. Another major workload driver are events prompting changes in military capabilities, many of which involve incidents or conflict trends that necessitate new policies and training (e.g., the increased prevalence of uncrewed aerial systems creates the need for new troop capabilities), hence the proposed merger of the Policy and Doctrine Team and the Military Performance Evaluation Team, and the proposed creation of the Military Expertise Section. Finally, the reform initiatives in 2019 shifted parts of management responsibilities from the Executive Office of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the Office of Military Affairs. Accordingly, it is proposed to create a Military Management and Support Section focusing on the strategic planning and administration of the Office of Military Affairs.",

The deteriorating terrain has led to increased vehicle wear and tear, necessitating regular maintenance that exceeds the current staffing capacity.

/**
 * Entity × Entity co-citation matrix service.
 *
 * For a budget version, computes how many distinct document symbols (mandates)
 * each pair of entities BOTH cite — the data behind the appendix heatmap in
 * docs/UN_MIR_2025_2144.pdf (p.42).
 *
 * A pair's "shared" count = |symbols(entity A) ∩ symbols(entity B)| within the
 * version. The diagonal (an entity with itself) is each entity's own distinct
 * symbol count and is reported separately via `totals` (rendered blank in the
 * matrix). Symbols are normalized the same way as
 * services/documents/metadata.ts so spacing variants match.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this app does

Internal UN tool for reviewing **mandates** in the Programme Budget. Entity reviewers log in, inspect the document citations ("mandates") backing each budget part of their entity, and record housekeeping decisions (keep / remove / etc.) plus comments. Decisions feed the next budget cycle. The current review cycle is **ppb2026** (producing input for PPB 2027).

## Commands

Package manager is **pnpm** (Node app) and **uv** (Python). Do not use npm/pip.

```bash
pnpm dev            # Next.js dev server
pnpm build          # production build (also runs as a pre-commit hook on `main`)
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint           # eslint
pnpm format         # prettier --write on src/**
uv sync             # install Python deps (root project + worker workspace)
```

There is **no test suite**. Verify changes with `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build`. A Husky pre-commit hook runs `pnpm build` only when committing on the `main` branch, so builds must be green before committing to main.

## Architecture

Four cooperating pieces (see [docs/DOCX_UPLOAD.md](docs/DOCX_UPLOAD.md)):

- **Next.js** (`src/`) — control plane: auth, UI, orchestration, exports. Next.js 16 App Router + React 19.
- **Postgres** (Azure Flexible Server) — single source of truth.
- **Azure Blob** — storage for uploaded DOCX files.
- **Python** — ingestion engine for DOCX parsing/normalization (`python/`, `worker/`).

### Database access — raw `pg`

All DB access goes through the raw `pg` pool in [src/lib/db/db.ts](src/lib/db/db.ts): use `query()` and `transaction()`. The pool connects via Azure's built-in PgBouncer on port 6432 (transaction pooling mode); max 10 connections per Vercel function instance. Write parameterized SQL — no named prepared statements, which is also required for PgBouncer transaction pooling compatibility.

Two Postgres schemas:
- `mandates_housekeeping.*` — this app's own state: `users`, `magic_tokens`, `allowed_domains`, `allowed_reviewers`, `mandate_decisions`, `mandate_comments`, `entity_review_mode`, `review_change_responses`, `docx_uploads`.
- `ppb2026.*` — shared upstream budget data this app reads: `source_document_citations`, `source_documents`, `source_documents_metadata_clean`, `budget_documents`, `budget_document_versions`.

SQL schema and migrations live in [sql/](sql/) (`sql/schema/`, `sql/migrations/`). They are applied manually/externally — there is no migration runner in the app.

#### Querying the DB from the shell

To run ad-hoc queries, use the **`DATABASE_URL_CLAUDE`** env var (not `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"   # psql is from brew libpq, not on default PATH
psql "$DATABASE_URL_CLAUDE" -c "..."
```

### Budget version scoping (critical gotcha)

`ppb2026.source_document_citations` holds citations for **multiple budget cycles**. Every citation query **must** be scoped to the current version or rows from other cycles leak into the UI (e.g. entities appear twice). Always inline the predicate from [src/lib/db/budget-version.ts](src/lib/db/budget-version.ts) (`versionPredicateSql(alias)`, `CURRENT_BUDGET_VERSION`) into citation `WHERE` clauses.

### Code organization — feature-first under `src/features/`

The app is organized by feature, each holding `actions/` (`"use server"` server actions), `services/` (pure data/business logic, called from server components and actions), and `ui/` (client components).

- `src/features/auth/` — magic-link auth, session, mail.
- `src/features/mandates/` — the core domain. Subfolders: `services/` (`data-service.ts`, `reference-data.ts`, `mandate-warnings.ts`, `age-indicator.ts`, `decision-reasons.ts`), `services/documents/` (metadata, versions, newer-version detection), `services/export/` (DOCX/Excel/applied-state export), `actions/` (decisions, comments, review-mode, review-baselines, realtime).

`src/components/` holds shared/page components; `src/components/ui/` is shadcn/ui primitives (never edit these directly — compose around them). `src/app/` is App Router routes. `src/lib/` holds db, storage, theme, constants, utils.

> ⚠️ [docs/STRUCTURE.md](docs/STRUCTURE.md) and [docs/DATA.md](docs/DATA.md) describe an older `src/lib/services/` layout and a `housekeeping-actions.ts` monolith. That refactor is **done** — code now lives under `src/features/mandates/`. Trust the actual tree over those docs.

### Auth

Custom magic-link auth — no third-party auth library.
- Login is restricted to allowed domains/emails (`allowed_domains`, `allowed_reviewers` tables); `isValidUnEmail` enforces `@un.org`.
- A magic token is emailed (SMTP via nodemailer), exchanged for an HMAC-signed session cookie (`auth_session`).
- Route protection is in [src/proxy.ts](src/proxy.ts) — this is Next.js 16's renamed middleware (`proxy`, not `middleware`). It verifies the cookie via Web Crypto and redirects unauthenticated users to `/about`. Public paths: `/login`, `/verify`, `/about`.

### Realtime

No websockets. Collaboration is **polling-based**: [src/hooks/useRealtimeDecisions.ts](src/hooks/useRealtimeDecisions.ts) polls the `realtime` server action (~3s) to sync other reviewers' decisions and review-mode status.

### API routes

Used only where App Router needs a real HTTP endpoint (see [src/app/api/README.md](src/app/api/README.md)): `/api/export/...` (file downloads) and `/api/upload/docx` (file uploads). Everything else uses server actions/server components, not API routes.

### Python

Two distinct contexts (uv workspace, members declared in `pyproject.toml`):
- `python/` — analysis & ingestion scripts run locally (`llm_relevance.py` uses Azure OpenAI, `analysis.py`, `ppb_extraction/` parses PPB DOCX into per-entity data). Run with `uv run`.
- `worker/ppb-docx-worker/` — Azure Function worker for async DOCX ingestion (currently scaffolding/TODO). Regenerate its pinned deps with `bash worker.sh` after editing `worker/pyproject.toml`. Deployed via `.github/workflows/deploy-docx-worker.yml`.

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode; avoid `any`. Define explicit prop/action/API types (`src/types/`).
- Prefer Server Components; add `"use client"` only for interactive parts.
- Data fetching, calculations, and processing belong in `services/` (and server `actions/`), **not** in components.
- shadcn/ui: add components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`; compose around `components/ui/` primitives rather than editing them.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS **v4.1** (use current v4 syntax, not v3). Theme tokens and the UN color palette (esp. `un-blue`) live in [src/lib/theme.ts](src/lib/theme.ts); prefer them.
- Design: left-align, minimal, clear visual hierarchy.
- Secrets via `.env` / `process.env` only (see `.env.example`: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, SMTP, Azure Storage, Azure OpenAI).
- Don't create parallel infrastructure or hardcode where a global/shared solution exists.

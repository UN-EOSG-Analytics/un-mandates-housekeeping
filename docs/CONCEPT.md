we want a tool that programme officers can use to report mandate citations for the UN PPB 2027

they will have to logon with their UN email (we will send them a single sign on every time they sign in) and then they should be able to see last years mandates from Postgres (static metadata) 

and tag them with dropdown RETAIN / REVIEW / REMOVE

or ADD new mandates (different postgres table)

these new additions would have to be captured somewhere as well
as well as the dropdown decisions and also by whom they were made

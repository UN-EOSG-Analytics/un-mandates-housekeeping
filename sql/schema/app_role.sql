-- Dedicated database role for the mandates-housekeeping app.
--
-- The app (Next.js on Vercel, see src/lib/db/db.ts) should connect via
-- DATABASE_URL using this role instead of the server admin account.
--
-- Privilege profile (least privilege, derived from actual app queries):
--   mandates_housekeeping  read/write (app's own schema)
--   ppb2026                read-only  (budget documents, citations)
--   systemchart.entities   read-only  (canonical entity list)
--   public.documents       read-only
--   public.issuing_bodies  read-only
--
-- The role deliberately has NO ddl rights (no CREATE on any schema):
-- migrations keep running as the admin/owner role, not as the app.
--
-- The password is not stored in this file. Provide it at execution time:
--   psql -v app_password='<secret>' -f sql/schema/app_role.sql

create role mandates_housekeeping_app login password :'app_password';

comment on role mandates_housekeeping_app is 'Application role for the mandates-housekeeping app (read/write on mandates_housekeeping, read-only elsewhere). No DDL rights.';
